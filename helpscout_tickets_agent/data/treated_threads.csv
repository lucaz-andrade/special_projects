After reviewing further, I found that the significant difference in Total Sales for the Texas Q2 2025 period (4/1/25-6/30/25) was due to the recalculation of sales tax for the bookmarks that was previously done. After redoing and correcting the recalculation work, we now have the total sales numbers for TX: Total Texas Sales: $5,711.00 This includes $196.00 (rounded up from $195.65) in sales in TX through Amazon. This includes $5,515.00 (rounded down from 5,515.19) in sales in TX through Shopify. This is made up of the $5,483.79 Net Item Sales amount and the $31.40 Total Shipping amount. Taxable Sales: $5,515.00 Resolving this difference also changed the estimated tax due to $452.72 , which includes $282.35 of tax that was collected and $170.37 in tax that was not collected; Zamp recalculated accordingly. I've triple-checked the amounts and work here; these are accurate.

Currently, all of our sales are direct-to-consumer via Stripe (which, of course, integrates seamlessly with you). For a particular B2B deal, we'll be selling 150 devices and memberships in bulk to a Californian university, who will then distribute them to staff and students. We're currently at 60% of the $500k CA threshold, and this transaction would take us up to 80%, so no issues around tax collection, we're more looking for guidance on how best to handle the threshold tracking in this case. A couple of options we were considering: Manually import the transaction into Zamp via CSV, alongside our regular Stripe-collected transactions. Preferred. We can raise an invoice outside of Stripe. Raise a manual invoice in Stripe and have Zamp handle tax collection as you do with our usual B2C sales. Slightly cautious with this, as reporting may be impacted (and also individual tax thresholds - see below) due to the way our Stripe is currently set up. In addition, we plan to activate the memberships via 100% discount in Stripe for each of the 150 users, but unsure if this may create tax threshold implications on a per-user basis - could you comment on this? Be good to get your input. Thanks in advance!

NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED -- please hold off on approvals/processing.

New issue:
When we do an EDIT ORDER (eg a size change from XS to S), we know already that we need to manually minus out the 'duplicate' item - since only 1 item was shipped.
However, it seems if the shipped item ends up getting returned for refund anyway, Zamp is NOT recording the tax adjustment for that returned item.

Example order: Only 1 item ordered -- price $195. Only 1 item paid. Size changed from XS to S/4 (via Edit Order). See 3 line items in Zamp calculation below: Because of the edit order, Zamp currently thinks 2 items were sold, for a total of $390 with $34.14 in tax. There seems to be a manual deduction (I think by Chris) that deducts the 1 duplicate item, resulting in -$16.27 in tax. However, after the item actually shipped (S/4 size in this example), and the customer decides to return for refund, we should get a negative tax adjustment of lets say $16.27 or $17-- but that's missing now. Chris -- please have a look at this example, and we can discuss today before 5:30pm EST if you have time.

We are out of the office on Thursday and Friday, so would need to review today.

And then once we find the logic issue here, let's pls go back and search for and adjust for all similar cases (Edit Order + Refund afterwards).

Thanks,
Jason",hi Chris Ashley NEW ISSUE identify hold approval processing new issue edit order eg size change XS S know need manually minus duplicate item 1 item ship ship item end getting return refund Zamp record tax adjustment return item example order 1 item order price $ 195 1 item pay Size change XS s/4 Edit Order 3 line item Zamp calculation edit order Zamp currently think 2 item sell total $ 390 $ 34.14 tax manual deduction think Chris deduct 1 duplicate item result -$16.27 tax item actually ship s/4 size example customer decide return refund negative tax adjustment let $ 16.27 $ 17 miss Chris look example discuss today 5:30pm est time office Thursday Friday need review today find logic issue let pls search adjust similar case Edit Order + refund Jason

First, we're happy to share that our engineering team has released some significant improvements since mid-June that now properly account for these transaction scenarios with Shopify transactions: Voided/Expired transactions - we now create a separate refund transaction to account for these. I validated this by reviewing voided orders within a Shopify export and comparing them to Zamp. Partial refunds that are not order edits are captured, and I validated this by reviewing 'partially_refunded' orders within a Shopify export and comparing them against Zamp. The above means that I made adjustments to Shopify Transactions within Zamp by reviewing 'partially_paid' and 'paid' transactions from a 'web' source with a positive outstanding balance. Please note that the process we previously agreed upon remains unchanged, except for the updates mentioned above regarding voided/expired/partial refund adjustments. We also have additional work scheduled to start in August 2025 to reattempt finding a solution for order edits within Shopify. Meaning—there's a chance these adjustments won't be necessary in the future, but we don't yet have an exact timeline. I've also adjusted for the remaining prior period refunds in California and Colorado. I've attached three files: A file showing the Shopify adjustment transaction work. An export of the Zamp Transactions for states with filings this month. This includes a Pivot table showing tax amounts by state. The tax-due estimate I sent previously is also included in this file.

Although I don't currently have a transaction-by-transaction tax rate file to share, I've identified the cause of the difference in tax due expectations here. Regarding Pennsylvania: We found that for PA, just the state rate (6%) was collected on some of the transactions, which did not include any locals (there are two in PA), and this ties into some details that Matt Grattan shared on 7/10/25 around ensuring not to overcharge customers when rates change throughout the state, and over time. Once we recalculated the PA Transactions to match Zamp's expectations, the tax-due estimate was updated to a number closer to your expectation. The estimated tax-due amount is now: $4,291.38 . This includes a timely filing discount of $43.35. Regarding Texas: Texas is a bit of a tricky situation, which we share more details about here , with Business-to-Business Software as a Service (B2B SaaS) because our understanding and Zamp's calculation engine considers the below information, which differs from a flat 8.25% rate across the board: Texas considers SaaS a data processing service, which subjects it to an 80% sales tax on the service's price. This also means that 20% of the price of a SaaS service in Texas is considered tax-exempt. The above leads to the following amounts and breakdown, which align with the tax-due estimate for TX: A taxable sales amount of $7,810 - these are sales to non-exempt entities. The original non-exempt total sales amount (excluding non-profit sales) was $9,762.78 , which the taxable amount noted above represents as 80% of. A tax-due estimate of $644.33 , less a timely filing discount of $3.22 , for a total estimated tax due of $641.11 . The above means that the $ 641.11 tax-due amount is our estimate of the correct amount, considering the taxability of SaaS in Texas. A question and next steps: Do we have your approval to move forward with filings for both Texas and Pennsylvania? These two states have due dates of the 20th this month, and we want to ensure timely filing.

I believe we have everything sorted out for the current filings due this month in California and Washington. We'll work on documenting this process internally to ensure this is accounted for accurately and smoothly from now on. A few items to note: 1) We cleared out all of the transactions in Zamp and recreated the transactions utilizing the reports Renee shared, and the custom Zamp invoice list report. 2) We imported California Transactions and did not import any Washington Transactions because the sales tax liability for WA showed a negative balance (see the attached file.) This is something we can help address in future WA sales tax filings, to recover overpaid tax. 3) I sent an updated tax-due estimate to Chuck and Renee. When accounting for sales tax rounding (which CA requires, at the jurisdiction-level), the estimate is within $3.36. A few questions: 1) Urgent —do we have your approval to proceed with the sales tax filings in WA and CA for Q2 2025? Our filing team can file these on time, but the faster we can proceed with approval, the better. 2) Regarding invoices in non-nexus states or states where tax is not yet collected, and this might be a question for Beth or Renee: This will help us ensure that we accurately determine if Forcible Entry has crossed an economic nexus threshold in states other than Washington or California. The reports Renee shared are sales-tax-focused and likely won't work for states without tax collection (yet). Could we utilize the Zamp Sales Tax Report (which is a 'Invoice List' custom report) and follow the steps below, in the interest of maintaining consistency with cash-based accounting?

I hope that your time out of the office is enjoyable or what it needs to be. We're more than happy to work through questions that come up here over email.

I hope things improve and settle down (in a good way) on your end, sooner rather than later! After fixing the 'overpaid tax' adjustment for California, the new estimated tax due is $58,462. The other state's differences are typically due to the usual reasons associated with rounding, timely filing discounts (e.g., GA or VA), time-zone differences (Shopify operates in PST, while Zamp files in PST, EST, CST, MST, etc.), and the items noted in this article . The other cause for differences will be the overpaid tax adjustments for IL, GA, and VA. We'll dig into the gross sales differences you noted between Zamp and Shopify for California and follow up as soon as we have more information. This is likely to be next week, or the week after (if we escalate to engineering).

The taxability of shipping varies from state to state, and in all kinds of scenarios; we're here to help with that. Labor may or may not be taxable depending on the kind of service involved. What types of services would you be referring to? We have a few that might fit this kind of category, but this may also be something to run by our Tax Research team for confirmation. These are the categories we currently support: The "" TPP "" below refers to "" Tangible Personal Property "", which is generally taxable products. Regarding the PDF you shared and CCF_000129: I reviewed this further and also triple-checked some items within your Zamp account for your Texas sales tax registration. I found that when Zamp registered Accelerated Tooling LLC in Texas, we registered you with a 'Single Local Tax Rate' license type in that state. This is similar to other simplified sales tax rate licenses and programs in different states, and it's typically used by out-of-state businesses. The Single Local Tax Rate for Texas with this type of sales tax registration is 8% on all transactions, regardless of the shipping address. For this order and considering shipping taxable, $3.36 would be 8% of $42.00 . This means that a single sales tax rate is collected on orders shipping to customers within Texas, and here are some resources about this: Under ' How to Collect Sales Tax on Interstate Texas Sales ' in our Texas Sales Tax Guide, here . On the TX Comptroller's page here . I hope this helps, and please let us know if we can assist with anything!",hi Chris thank share know shipping taxable Texas labor worry taxability shipping vary state state kind scenario help Labor taxable depend kind service involve type service refer fit kind category run Tax Research team confirmation category currently support TPP refer Tangible Personal Property generally taxable product pdf share CCF_000129 review triple check item Zamp account Texas sale tax registration find Zamp register Accelerated Tooling LLC Texas register Single Local Tax rate license type state similar simplified sale tax rate license program different state typically state business Single Local Tax Rate Texas type sale tax registration 8 transaction regardless shipping address order consider ship taxable $ 3.36 8 $ 42.00 mean single sale tax rate collect order ship customer Texas resource collect sale Tax Interstate Texas Sales Texas Sales Tax Guide TX Comptroller page hope help let know assist

These sales are being attributed to California and artificially triggering nexus, even though the end customer address is located elsewhere and they have not actually met nexus thresholds in CA. Could you please advise on the best path forward to ensure the customer’s shipping address—rather than eBay’s California authentication address—is used for nexus determination? Specifically: Is it possible to adjust the mapping within the eBay integration to reflect the actual customer address? If not, would you recommend the customer use CSV uploads instead to ensure accurate reporting? Is there any other workaround available that allows us to continue using the eBay integration while resolving this? Appreciate your help in looking into this!

When we export orders from BigCommerce and compare them to Zamp, we find amounts that vary from what you shared and from what Zamp has as the tax-due estimate for this month (June 2025 and Q2 2025 filings). That said, and because Dorm Company has a Florida filing, we're right up against an internal deadline (end of the day today, 7/16) to ensure that Florida and other states are filed on time. A few questions: 1) Would it be OK with you if we proceed with filings as they are this month, with the tax-due estimated and listed on the 7/7/25 email? This will enable us to ensure timely filing and also provide additional time for review and troubleshooting. Then, if we find the cause, we can account for the difference in future filing periods (e.g., July 2025 filed in August, or Q3 2025 filed in October). 2) When you have a moment, could you please share any files, supporting work, or links to the review you (or your team) did of the tax amounts that were collected? This can help us compare further, and we should be able to find the root cause. One way or another, we'll get this sorted out.

To confirm, were those totals based on a combination of the transactions and data from within BigCommerce? Are there any other sources? Everything should be through BigCommerce or Square, as Amazon collects and remits as a Marketplace Facilitator. The Square transactions that we see from June were from TN and TX. There are some timely filing discounts included in our estimates, but they aren't large enough to account for these variances. I definitely see what you're referring to with the amounts being low. We'll investigate this further on Monday, while comparing it to BigCommerce data. Just to be safe, the total for tax collected for California for Q2 (which I believe is April 1st - June 30th, correct me if I'm wrong) was $7,571.13. Does California need to be rechecked? This is interesting to hear, as CA should likely also have a larger amount. Here are some details for CA's Q2 2025 filing, as Zamp's tax-due estimates now fully account for the quarterly prepayments made in CA: 1st Prepayment - $2,073.00 2nd Prepayment - $1,748.00 Total Prepayments - $3,821.00 We see a total tax collected in CA of $5,757.00 , which is lower than your estimate.

The above means that the amount Zamp would estimate to be filed would be closer to $21,395.62 after subtracting those prepayments. Please note that, since New York follows a fiscal quarter (e.g., Q2 is June 2025 through August 2025), Zamp's tax-due estimate for NY would be considered the first prepayment associated with the NY Q2 2025 sales tax filing. A few questions: 1) Considering the above, do we have your approval to proceed with ETERNE's filings this month? 2) Regarding NY—if you'd like us to confirm the prepayment and filing amounts for this state, could you please reset or update your NY password and share it with us?

Please could you also confirm receipt of the request to switch the Shopify Zamp connection back to the live Zamp account this Friday ? Yes—we will switch the Shopify Zamp connection back the production Zamp account and I've set a reminder on my end to ensure this is completed tomorrow morning (7/11/25.) Please can you confirm orders look correct in Zamp? Yes—the orders look correct within Zamp. After further investigation and comparison, I found that the order count difference was due to: Shopify does not create separate refund Transactions (it's noted within the order), but Zamp does create separate refund and order transactions. This happens because Zamp utilizes a ledger-based accounting approach, which creates a clear line of separation between orders and refunds. Some orders were not synced to the Zamp Sandbox account because they had order dates before the initial sync range (in April 2025); the initial sync was 5/1/25 and forward. After resyncing transactions, the order count totals match, when accounting for separate refunds. And also confirm the UK time window you'll be switching the Shopify connection to your live instance? Sure! What UK time window would be best for you all here? I usually start my day around 9 AM EST (1 PM UK time), but we can also target  a later time up to 11 PM EST (4 AM UK time) if that's better. Otherwise we can check with the broader team to see if anyone has a different availability.

Most of the differences appear to be related to the following items: Timely filing discounts in each state. Our tax-due estimates automatically account for these. For CO, this discount is $93.96 For SC, this discount is $11.72. Rounding NC appears to fall into this category, and possibly time zones as well. Time zone differences between Stripe and Zamp: Zamp would file using EST in NC and SC. We'll file using MST in CO. We see these kinds of differences commonly with Shopify, but similar logic would apply to Stripe, depending on the time zone used in Stripe's reports/views. So that you know, these differences are expected and compliant.

I've broken down the details and responses into separate categories below, based on your findings and our following review. A tax-due estimate will be sent out shortly. Transactions that we adjusted: After we looked into this further, we found that some of the transactions (listed below) did need adjustments, likely due to partial refunds or order edits. 7224535154750 7236358078526 7235996418110 7235996418110 Transactions we found did not need adjustment: 1) The transaction noted below wasn't showing up in a Shopify export or report because in Shopify, it has a date of 5/31/25 at 9:09 PM, and in Zamp, the date is adjusted for the state's time zone to 6/1/25 at 4:09 AM. 7189832761406 2) The transaction noted below was sold through Shopify's SHOP Marketplace (specifically, the Shop app) and Zamp automatically marks these transactions with $0 tax because SHOP is acting as a Marketplace Facilitator for this transaction and remits the tax collected to the relevant state; Shopify shares more details about that here . 7210012540990 (aka, HOS4524612118 ) A note about this is displayed in Shopify here when reviewing the specific order. 3) The transactions noted below are related to Shopify orders that had refunds.

We can assume that if the transaction was imported without errors and shows up on the transactions page , it was included. That said, I do see the county associated with that transaction (from looking up Elon University's address ) on the NC report, but it splits the county tax from the state tax, so it doesn't match the full amount (if that makes sense). We can dive deeper using the variance reviewing query here , and look for the transaction's ID in the export (columns A or B for externalName/externalId.) I did this and confirmed the transaction was listed, which means we calculated taxes for it and bucketed it into the NC report/summary.

I'll share some details below that I believe will help ensure we're on the same page. :) I want to make sure that whichever way we do it Zamp is calculating the correct tax amount that has been collected ans should be remitted. Agreed! I want to confirm this as well. The good news here is that Zamp's Shopify integration has logic in place that can look for either handling of US sales taxes: Tax exclusive - tax listed separately. Tax inclusive - tax included in the product price. As if the system assumes we are including it in the price in the USA, but we are now adding it to the price, then the system may be calculating the wrong numbers To my understanding and review, Zamp will be able to detect whether the Shopify transaction has tax included in the price, or if it's now added to the price (separately). Meaning—our system's calculations will differ, depending on whether Shopify tells us how the tax is included in the price or not. Our Shopify integration (system) will handle both situations and calculate correctly from there. As i understand it in both cases Shopify itemises the tax collected out into a line in the order so would assume the system should just be looking at this ""tax total"" line? Yes—we do look at the 'tax total' line, and we also look for a property the Shopify API provides us with called taxesIncluded , and our integration handles it from there (Based on if this is 'true' or 'false').

Could you please share more about why this might be the wrong approach here? I just want to ensure we're on the same page, as I may have misunderstood when you noted the following. We recently updated our settings on the 26th June so that tax is now charged at checkout instead of included from the order total. When I review your Zamp account's transactions from April 1, 2025, to June 25, 2025, I see that Zamp is bucketing transactions with tax collected across various date ranges and states. My understanding is that the tax was included in the cost of items sold. I also see tax collected from June 26, 2025, to June 30, 2025. After reviewing the code related to our Shopify integration, I found that we support tax-inclusive pricing (included in the item's cost), which was introduced late last year. That said, it is correct that the best and most compliant approach is to list sales tax separately (also known as tax-exclusive pricing, where the tax is not included in the item's cost). This compliance piece focuses more on complying with sales tax regulations than on reporting and filing. We'll continue to hold Drool Arts filings this month as we discuss this further. However, please keep in mind that we need to have the various state filings moving along in the process by the end of the day tomorrow (7/16/25) to ensure timely filing.",hi Edley thank response wrong approach share wrong approach want ensure page misunderstood note following recently update setting 26th June tax charge checkout instead include order total review Zamp account transaction April 1 2025 June 25 2025 Zamp bucket transaction tax collect date range state understanding tax include cost item sell tax collect June 26 2025 June 30 2025 review code relate Shopify integration find support tax inclusive pricing include item cost introduce late year say correct good compliant approach list sale tax separately know tax exclusive pricing tax include item cost compliance piece focus comply sale tax regulation reporting filing continue hold Drool Arts filing month discuss mind need state filing move process end day tomorrow 7/16/25 ensure timely filing

We can fast-track the investigation here, considering the critical meeting on Monday, as we'd like to ensure we handle this in the way that best helps you. Regarding Pennsylvania: The tax-due estimate for Pennsylvania is $201.23, which includes a timely filing discount in PA. Here's the breakdown: We see a total tax collected of $203.32. There is a timely filing discount in PA of $2.03. The remainder of the difference ($0.06) appears related to rounding within the sales tax logic; these slight differences can happen due to the nature of sales tax. Regarding Michigan: Within Zamp, I found that $137.59 in tax was collected for customers located in Michigan.. The reason Zamp is noting that $1.40 is due is due to two reasons: There is a timely filing discount in MI of $2.80 (the full tax due Zamp calculated is $4.20 .) Within Zamp, our system is designed to view digital products (R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS) as tax-exempt in Michigan, which means we'd expect $0 tax to be collected on those transactions. This means that we see $133.39 of the $137.59 tax collected as over-collection. We have the option here to ask our filing team to file the $137.59 amount instead of the $1.40 (less any timely filing discounts). Then, later this month, we could schedule a meeting or discuss via email to determine why more tax was collected than Zamp would expect. Would you like me to ask our filing team to file the $137.59, less any timely filing discounts, in MI? Please let us know if you have any questions!",hi Tammy thank context fast track investigation consider critical meeting Monday like ensure handle way well help Pennsylvania tax estimate Pennsylvania $ 201.23 include timely filing discount PA breakdown total tax collect $ 203.32 timely filing discount PA $ 2.03 remainder difference $ 0.06 appear relate round sale tax logic slight difference happen nature sale tax Michigan Zamp find $ 137.59 tax collect customer locate Michigan reason Zamp note $ 1.40 reason timely filing discount MI $ 2.80 tax Zamp calculate $ 4.20 Zamp system design view digital product r_dig_digital product tax exempt Michigan mean expect $ 0 tax collect transaction mean $ 133.39 $ 137.59 tax collect collection option ask filing team file $ 137.59 instead $ 1.40 timely filing discount later month schedule meeting discuss email determine tax collect Zamp expect like ask filing team file $ 137.59 timely filing discount MI let know question

I've looked into this further and we don't currently see any WooCommerce Transactions within your Zamp account. This may not be an issue, as you noted they're syncing to WooCommerce. However, I have a few questions to help us ensure everything is aligning as it should be. 1) What was the WooCommerce Order ID and zip code for the test Alabama transaction? 2) Do you happen to know what this WooCommerce order should show up as within QuickBooks? What is the invoice number? Was this related to Invoice 461 with the name 'Test' with a Ship To address in Foley, AL? Ideally, we'll also ensure that there aren't duplicate transactions between QuickBooks Online and WooCommerce.",Hi Sandy appreciate patience Happy Monday look currently WooCommerce Transactions Zamp account issue note sync WooCommerce question help ensure align 1 WooCommerce Order ID zip code test Alabama transaction 2 happen know WooCommerce order QuickBooks invoice number relate Invoice 461 test ship address Foley AL ideally ensure duplicate transaction QuickBooks Online WooCommerce

Please let us know if this helps! 1) The CA amount ($379.29) aligns with the taxes collected in June, but Q2 should be much higher? Yes—the amount Zamp estimates will be remitted to the state (paid/due) should align with the June 2025 tax collected amounts, and this is what we see occur with clients who California has assigned a quarterly Prepay filing frequency. This happens because our tax-due estimate already accounts for the prepayments made for Otteroo in CA: 1st Prepayment - $459.00 2nd Prepayment - $458.00 Total Prepayments - $917.00 2) Is WA is higher than what I see in shopify due to B&O tax? Yes—this should be due to the B&O tax in Washington, as that amount is $21.90 for Q2 2025. 3) Maryland in Shopify (for all of 2024) is about $130 higher than what I see on zamp Just so you know, part of this difference is likely due to a timely filing discount of $5.42; however, this only accounts for a portion of the discrepancy. Overall, this difference is likely due to the date range associated with the MD filing frequency assigned to Otteroo by the MD Department of Revenue, which is a Fiscal Annual filing frequency that covers the period from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. When you have a moment, could you please confirm the following items with us to help with this investigation? The date range associated with the MD Transaction review in Shopify. A screenshot or copy of an export from Shopify for MD is being used to compare here. We'll also hold Otteroo's filings until we have approval to proceed, due to the questions here, as we want to ensure timely and accurate filing.

We've made the necessary updates to adjust by an amount close to what you noted and shared in the Shopify vs Zamp comparison file.

We include this amount in our tax-due estimate. The B&O Tax amount for Q2 2025 was $518.80 , while the difference you noted was $690.03. This means that we adjusted WA by $171.23.

We can certainly understand your perspective, and we would like to partner with you to resolve this situation. A slight difference, such as 1.25% (even if the dollar amount seems high), is very likely related to time zone differences between Zamp and Shopify. Zamp's tax-due estimate and filings will use the US time zone that aligns with the state's capital, meaning we use EST, CST, MST, PST, Hawaiian Time, and Alaskan Time across the various states. We'll dive into this further and confirm if the difference is related to time zones. If that's the case, our recommendation would be against adjusting by this amount, as it would mean not remitting tax to the various states. If time zones aren't the cause, we'll find the root cause and work with you to adjust the data accordingly. We should have more details to share or questions by early next week.

If you delete the transaction now, we can manually import a refund version of this transaction to account for it. Ultimately, the transaction could be left as it is so that the original data used to file for Virginia remains intact. Then, when we manually create the refund for this transaction, we can note on the line item description that this is a refund because the transaction was canceled, never shipped, and refunded. Does the above work well for you here? The 4 day window provided (truly 3 with the holiday) is really tight. Is there any way to expand that? We appreciate your feedback and understand your perspective. We'll share this with the broader team and consider any possibilities. The tricky portion of these situations is that the state filing due dates (each state's deadlines) don't change to account for holidays, and Zamp's filing timeframe and approval windows are designed to ensure we file timely for all Zamp customers, while optimizing for efficiency across teams.",Hi Ken thank response delete transaction adjust correctly month sure delete transaction manually import refund version transaction account ultimately transaction leave original datum file Virginia remain intact manually create refund transaction note line item description refund transaction cancel ship refunded work 4 day window provide truly 3 holiday tight way expand appreciate feedback understand perspective share broad team consider possibility tricky portion situation state filing date state deadline change account holiday Zamp filing timeframe approval window design ensure file timely zamp customer optimize efficiency team

I'm following up to note that we were able to account for the below invoices that were voided/refunded: SS15179 SS15730 That said, there is a larger population of voided invoices that we're unable to account for due to low or $0 tax collected in the state(s) associated with the transaction. The reason for this is that Zamp is unable to file negative amounts in any state or any state's local jurisdiction. We're currently developing a plan to move forward and track the remaining voided transactions in future filing periods. I'll also share a list with you so that we're all on the same page.

I wanted to follow up to note that we couldn't find the below invoices (these were voided) within Zamp: 9134 - This one appears in QuickBooks Online, but not in Zamp; we're unsure why it didn't sync, as the original logs would have been more than 30-60 days old. 9259 - This one wasn't found within QuickBooks Online or Zamp, unless it's one we don't have access to within QBO, or it's in a different subsidiary/account. I searched a date range of 1/1/24-7/15/25 in attempts to find the invoices noted above within Zamp. The invoice noted below is a voided invoice that we were unable to account for because the specific local jurisdictions within MN that are involved, had sales except for the ST Paul City (Ramsey County) jurisdiction; meaning, a refund for the voided transaction would cause it to become negative and states don't allow negative amounts in their filings. 9007 For invoice 9007, we recommend including it next month, and we can re-evaluate each month as we move forward to determine if it can be accounted for.

(There are no entirely new Gamefound transactions for June, but make sure you saw the new BackerKit transactions on the previous email which are new June transactions.) My thought is that we should therefore show 10 June transactions, 5 which are reversals/credits of the original May transactions, and 5 of which are the ""rebilled"" transactions. Do you need me to add the 5 reversals to this spreadsheet as well, or is the 5 transactions in their ""new form"" enough? Or alternatively, do you have any thoughts on a better way to handle these?

First, the final wave from the old BackerKit for Minnesota sales. That's the easy part - attached in a spreadsheet. Second, the Gamefound. I expected that once I finished my transforms, which cross-reference the current state of the Gamefound data against what we have recognized as sales to date, I would show no new activity in June. I was right, except for five anomalous transactions that are showing me weird numbers. Investigating these, the best I can tell, these are orders that had to get redirected to an updated address at the last second, after we'd already given our warehouse the go-ahead to ship (and recognized the sale). The new address means the tax rate changed in Gamefound's system, and there's now additional sales tax on the orders from what there was when we previously reported them in May. But it also means we reported the sale in May to a state that is not the state where we got the product to in the end. And Gamefound's data doesn't make this clean for us - they don't give us a reverse sale in the original state and a new sale in the new state. They just make the edit and show us the final version. That's the problem with Gamefound reporting - anything new that happens to an order just changes the order, regardless of the date of the order, so it looks like the order has been that way since the beginning. There's no concept of a period closing or a change order to a transaction, just an unauditable edit. It doesn't even show you what the original ship-to state was - we have to cross-reference that in our data. The way these crowdfunding sites work means there's always going to be some weird error like this that creeps in and we won't report things like sales tax perfectly. Anyway, for these five transactions, on our end, I suppose the cleanest thing we can do is try to show a reverse sale at the original address and a new sale in the new address. I will get you the info on these five shortly...",hi Chris say piece June final wave old BackerKit Minnesota sale easy attach spreadsheet second Gamefound expect finish transform cross reference current state Gamefound datum recognize sale date new activity June right anomalous transaction show weird number investigate good tell order redirect update address second give warehouse ahead ship recognize sale new address mean tax rate change Gamefound system additional sale tax order previously report mean report sale state state get product end Gamefound datum clean reverse sale original state new sale new state edit final version problem Gamefound report new happen order change order regardless date order look like order way beginning concept period closing change order transaction unauditable edit original ship state cross reference datum way crowdfunde site work mean go weird error like creep will report thing like sale tax perfectly transaction end suppose clean thing try reverse sale original address new sale new address info shortly

} To improve the tax calculations in scenarios like the above, we'd recommend either implementing address validation API calls to Zamp's /addresses API endpoint or a similar solution. That said, I believe we could improve the API response handling in situations like this; I'll ensure this is raised with our engineering team. Regarding the Lincoln Way West address and ID 9ffb7a5e-209f-4e71-9827-978ba706f105: I was unable to find any tax calculation requests to our /calculations endpoint from June 25, 2025, through June 29, 2025, for the address noted below. I believe it happened and am just attempting to trace the behavior here before sending this over to our engineering team. 525 Lincoln Way W, South Bend, IN 46601 Part of the reason I'm mentioning the above and the question below is that I'm now seeing tax rates and a taxDue amount returned for this address: {

} A few questions: 1) For the  Lincoln Way West address, did the tax calculation request with a taxDue amount occur before 6/25/25? If so, this would make sense, as the logging improvement on our end was released on June 25, 2025, and I wouldn't have access to those logs. 2) Do you all have an address validation service that you already use? There are still a few items here that I'd like to escalate to our engineering team to determine the cause of this behavior and ensure the root cause is identified and resolved. The answers to the questions above will help ensure we have sufficient context for this situation.

Now, we are seeing the full rate returned for an address after triple-checking via internal tools and our API.

According to California tax regulations, should sales tax on Shipping & Handling charges be collected before early June? No—to our understanding , Shipping itself or Shipping & Handling when combined (not stated separately) is generally considered tax-exempt within California; this includes before early June 2025. Specifically, do we need to refund the Shipping & Handling tax for orders delivered to California prior to the beginning of June? Ultimately, the decision here is up to you (or the business). The taxes need to either be remitted to the state or refunded to the customer. If you decide to refund the tax on shipping to customers, please let us know, and we'll make sure it is accounted for in future sales tax filings processed for California. I'm noting this as we've seen businesses decide to handle this in many different ways, partly because processing refunds for every customer in scenarios like this is not always an easy undertaking.

After further investigation and review of internal situations associated with this discrepancy, we found that the difference in tax calculated was due to an improvement needed within Zamp regarding the taxability of Shipping & Handling in California. Our Engineering and Tax Research teams released the improvement to fix this, towards the beginning of June. Earlier in June 2025, and some cases before that month, Zamp was calculating tax on shipping for customers located in California. The above means that the Zamp API tax calculation response on June 30, 2025, is the correct and most up-to-date, accurate calculation. This also means that Shipping & Handling will be treated as tax-exempt by the Zamp API at this time.

Just for California, in April I showed $9,493.71 was due based on taxes charged and collected as they are Cash Basis, not accrual as per the balance sheet. You made a tax payment of $2428. In May, there was another $3,547.25 tax collected bringing the current total balance of $13040.96 due, for the remainder of April and May taxes collected. Your recent report shows just over $11.2k due for May alone. When Zamp was hired, part of the agreement I believed was making sure Quickbooks was charging and collecting taxes appropriately and everything was flowing properly. There are taxes on the books for other states, so are those being incorrectly charged or not being filed/paid? Bloom originally invited Zamp to be an accountant user in February 2025. This invitation was not accepted and another was sent yesterday which was accepted. Something is still not right which leads me to believe the taxes on invoices are perhaps not correct?

Our accounting team has been reviewing the transaction list and trying to reconcile it against what we see in Zamp and QuickBooks, and I wanted to share a few findings to get your thoughts. Two invoices (SS15043 & SS14457) are missing entirely from the transaction list. The Zamp export totals $88,499.49, but a large chunk of that is made up of what look like duplicate entries. When we remove all the duplicates, the total drops to $28,841.50. Zamp, however, shows a collected total of $31,350.90, so we're seeing a $2,500 discrepancy. We have also cross-checked against our NY QuickBooks account. Everything marked in green on the sheet has been matched. The items in red are missing from Zamp, and it's just those two invoices mentioned above. Would you mind taking a look and letting us know how Zamp is calculating the $31,350.90 total?

We'll continue with the monthly exports and look forward to truing up the numbers during the next filing period. Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states.

Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Askel, Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team jumping in! Thank you for the follow-up and for providing this data. *1)* OK, noted, and this makes sense to us. *2)* Normally, we would be able to include these additional orders in the tax calculations for the most recent reporting cycle, with filings due this month, July 2025. As of today (7/7/25), Ficks Music's sales tax filings, due this month, have been released. We didn't hear back before the deadline noted in the email, Thursday, 7/3/25, which was sent out on 7/1/25. - Meaning—the sales tax filings are already being processed and are in varying stages of submission to the various US states. We could handle this in a similar way to how we'd recommend handling the May 2025 transactions. *Question*—Are you OK with us including these transactions in the July 2025 filing period *3)* For the May 2025 transactions, we can include them along with the June 2025 transactions in the reporting and filing period processed for July 2025 in August 2025. *4)* Yes, that works for us! We recommend including all July 2025 transactions across all states, as this can help ensure that transactions from states that are filed quarterly or semi-annually are not missed. *Question*—Does that work for you and make sense in this context? -- Chris Ralph support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform> Hi Nick, As a follow-up to the thread below, attached are the exported orders for the following period: *January 1 - June 30* 1. You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us. I appreciate your diligence and patience, and I am happy to try and answer any other questions. -- Nick Kondak support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform> Hi Nick, - If order # SO1100000219 in row 19 was a regular order (not a refunded one) then the tax amount would be $7.01 - This would mean that the total, overall tax amount would be $87.48 across all orders on the spreadsheet - Since order # SO1100000219 was cancelled and refunded, it's as if it never happened, and so we can simulate this by simply removing that order from the spreadsheet. In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, The state totals I sent over was an export from our system. I attached a filtered CSV from the original file you sent over showing the tax total.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially?

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially?

This refund includes a total of $201.77 in tax that was refunded, and the Illinois jurisdiction associated with it reported $0 in sales for May 2025. The specific jurisdiction involved is CHICAGO CITY (COOK COUNTY). The reason this happens is that Illinois does not permit negative tax balances on its filings for local jurisdictions, such as Chicago. When this happens, Zamp reduces the filing for that jurisdiction to $0 (or, in this case, leaves it at $0).

That being said, rather than adjusting that prior liability to zero now, will it work to leave that as a liability debit on the books for now, and offset our June report for Minnesota with a $395.28 credit? In this situation, we should be able to account for it in the June 2025 filing period for Minnesota as long as there is enough tax collected to cover the $395.28 amount. The reason for that is that the various states do not allow negative local jurisdiction balances on their filings. After briefly reviewing the MN Q2 2025 data, we may be able to account for this credit, depending on the amount of sales bucketed into Ramsey County, MN, once it's time to file that return. Currently, the sales volume in this county is $2,763, with a tax of $14. Otherwise, the transaction would need to be moved forward until it can be accounted for. I can investigate this further by Tuesday and will follow up with the results or any additional findings. What is the best way to approach these adjustments? What do you need from me to report voided invoices? I believe we'd want a credit memo created in QuickBooks Online, referencing the invoice that was voided by it, for this purpose. If we want to track it there, we can create one.

One of our employees voided an invoice today from 11/26/2024. Invoice 9007, which was already included in our sales tax report as it's reported before the customer has paid. Unfortunately, this was an invoice before we fixed the ""location of sale"" issue popping up with QBO invoices and calculation of sales tax. So this should have been MN sales tax but was recorded as Arizona sales tax. That being said, rather than adjusting that prior liability to zero now, will it work to leave that as a liability debit on the books for now, and offset our June report for Minnesota with a $395.28 credit? That way I can make an accurate real time adjustment vs a retroactive one. What is the best way to approach these adjustments? What do you need from me to report voided invoices? I know we may have a few more this week as we are cleaning up A/R with our sales team. Thank you! Allie Stone Bookkeeper Handwrytten (602) 603-5137 handwrytten.com allie@handwrytten.com 9280 S.

When the total tax did not match on that transaction to the total tax that we had in our system, that is why we questioned whether the line had the wrong transaction ID or if the line had the wrong tax amount listed.

I should have clarified in my previous email that the negative amount shown in the new Report/Export I shared represents the tax-due estimate amount that has become negative within the specified local jurisdiction, rather than the transaction's entire refund amount.

The amounts are also broken up by jurisdiction for the transaction in question. Within Zamp, we have this transaction imported with the total tax amount as -$10.71 : In the future, I'll exclude that detail if it's preferable, and the initial goal was to illustrate the cause of the difference as negative local jurisdiction balances (while omitting a full explanation).

As discussed during our call on Friday, we confirmed that the timezone issue didn't affect the 2022-2024 historical data that was imported in February 2025; it was also recalculated for overdue filings in April 2025. We also reviewed the following months for Connecticut and found the causes noted below. The June 2025 CT tax-due estimate was higher due to a timezone issue. There were 23 CT Transactions with $11.53 in tax collected that were moved into June, in addition to the June 2025 transactions. The June file had $163.26 in tax collection. The combined total was $174.80 , which becomes $175.00 when applying Connecticut's rounding rules for their filings. The May 2025 tax-due estimate and tax remitted were lower due to the timezone issue. This amount was $156.75 in tax collected, which becomes $164.00 when applying CT's rounding rules for their filings. The April 2025 does appear to have been affected by the timezone issue. We're currently working on the January through April 2025 data to determine if and which transactions were also affected by this timezone issue. Once we've confirmed this, we'll update the data, share the results, and ensure that any transactions in states where Q2 2025 filings were already processed are moved forward, as we did with the May 2025 transactions. I've attached two files: a June XLSX file with tax totals by state and another XLSX file showing the May 2025 transactions that were moved into June 2025.

Both Jen and Persha were OK with us doing that. Separate issue: For CT 2023 Transactions, focusing on January 2023, the following details apply. They're seeing 7.35% in tax collected in their file for Sauce Transactions. Why does the tax liability and transaction page not match? This is happening because the SaaS/subscription transactions had $0 tax and needed to be recalculated, so the liability page and transactions page won't match there. Still, the gross sales should be higher for January 2023 for Connecticut, and likely other states as well. Even by the files that Nick shared here, it should be much higher. Jen estimated a bit over $300, while the file Nick shared showed $198 just in subscription revenue.

Yes—we've confirmed that the New York Q1 2025 filing had already been processed (on June 9, 2025) when the update was made for these transactions, which means that this change was not accounted for. This means that our approach to resolving this situation will need to change, and I'll share those steps below. We would need to know the dollar amounts associated with these transactions, as they have already been deleted from Zamp. We can manually create refund Transactions associated with the two Transaction IDs noted below, dated June 15, 2025. This will then ensure the tax is refunded to the Wayo when Zamp files the NY Q2 2025 return in September 2025.

In this case, Zamp is automatically recalculating transactions created via the API. This was the default and only option for a while. Now, we support disabling this with a recalculate property, but we want to be cautious about recommending it, as it could easily be abused. We can use the Variance Reviewing Metabase query to troubleshoot situations like this and look for: A positive or negative taxDue amount where the taxCollected amount is 0. No exemption, tax code, etc, is listed. Here's an export filtered to the transactions causing this: I deleted a few columns.

Additional transactions synced to Zamp between when the tax-due estimate is generated and when our filing team processes the filings.

We looked into this further and confirmed that the majority of the Connecticut tax-due estimate difference was related to missing the in-person Shopify POS Transactions. I also believe we've found the cause of this, and I'll share more details below. The other variances appear to be due to rounding, timely filing discounts (where Zamp's estimate is lower), and potentially time zone differences. We've manually imported those transactions for this month, and here's an updated tax-due estimate: State code Period Estimated sales tax AR May 2025 $57.00 CT May 2025 $1,080.00 GA May 2025 $244.31 IL May 2025 $622.00 KY May 2025 $119.07 MD May 2025 $191.41 MA May 2025 $545.89 MI May 2025 $290.93 NE May 2025 $56.70 NC May 2025 $498.03 OH May 2025 $511.97 RI May 2025 $47.14 UT May 2025 $69.81 VT May 2025 $81.03 VA May 2025 $266.49 WV May 2025 $55.25 Combined Total: $4,737.03 Question —do we now have your approval to proceed with Select Seeds' filings this month? We aim to have these moving along by the end of today, but we can hold them a bit, until the end of the day on Monday (6/16/25). The goal here is to ensure timely filing by the states' due dates. The cause of this: This issue occurred because the Zamp Shopify integration's access to your Shopify store is missing the "" read_location "" permission, a newer requirement that Shopify recently introduced. Specifically, it allows us to view the POS locations and associate those addresses with the transactions in Zamp. This permission can be added by going to: Settings —> Apps and sales channels —> click ""Develop Apps"" (in the top right) —> Zamp —> Configuration within your Shopify Admin. Then, click the ""Edit"" button next to ""Admin API integration."" Search for ""locations"" and add "" read_locations "" by checking the box. Click the black ""Save"" button. This was an item we reviewed in all Zamp customers' Shopify stores, but it was missed because there weren't POS Location sales for us to import from Select Seeds until May 2025. I'm also happy to hop on a cal l to walk through the above.

I do not see where these values are broken down on the CSV, so I am unsure where / how to enter. In this situation, the sales tax would be placed in the transactionTax column within the CSV template. At this time, Zamp does not currently support importing transactions with business use tax on the cost of goods, as Zamp's product and services are geared towards sales and use tax collected from customers. If you're referring to sales and use tax (some states call ""sales tax"" a form of ""use tax"" for out-of-state businesses), then it would belong in the transactionTax column as well (combined with sales tax). I've connected with Caroline about the business use tax piece, and this is something that could be discussed further. However, if there was an installation charge or other charge, should this also be included in the total or broken out? Yes—if there is a charge for a service or product that is tax-exempt or potentially taxed differently in various states, we'd recommend breaking that out into a separate row (with the same transactionId) on the CSV template. Then, in the last column of the attached example template, place the applicable tax code in the lineItemProductTaxCode column (column Q in the attached CSV). Ultimately, the decision to break this out separately or not is up to you (or the Iron Lion Entries team). If the installation charges are not billed independently, they will be considered taxable along with the rest of the transaction. I am attempting to populate the CSV from our filed reports. Does the order of the columns in the CSV matter or must they stay in the represented positions with ""transactionId"" in the first column, etc.? Yes—the order of the columns within the CSV file needs to remain as it is because Zamp's system is designed to import the sales data with the file's columns in the exact order of our template.

During our call, we confirmed that the Transaction Sync (bulk/historical) to Zamp is still not functioning, despite clearing the Zamp-related Scheduled Actions and verifying that an order did not have a Zamp Transaction Sync Status of ""Successful"". Here's my Calendly link to schedule a call for next week or after if preferred: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min These are the options for clearing any Zamp Tax-related transaction sync records and effectively ""resetting"" these items: Utilizing the WP-CLI Command via WP-CLI access. This involves creating a file, similar to the attached wp-cli-zamp-reset.php , within the store's theme or a must-use plugin. Run it with the command wp zamp reset-sync . Run the below functions via functions.php - see the attached file. Run the below SQL queries in phpMyAdmin or a similar tool. 2) The functions to run: function reset_zamp_sync_data() {
if (!current_user_can('manage_woocommerce')) {
return 'Insufficient permissions';
}

// Clean up scheduled actions
if (class_exists('ActionScheduler')) {
as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch', array(), 'zamp-transactions-sync');
}

// Clean up options
global $wpdb;
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->options} WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_sync_%'"");
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->options} WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_transactions_queue_%'"");

// Reset sync status
update_option('zamp_sync_status', 'ready');

// Clear transaction status meta
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->postmeta} WHERE meta_key IN ('zamp_transaction_status', 'zamp_transaction_date', 'zamp_transaction_error')"");

return 'Zamp sync data has been completely reset';
}

// Uncomment to run (then comment back after running once)
// add_action('init', function() {
// if (current_user_can('manage_woocommerce') && isset($_GET['reset_zamp_sync'])) {
// echo reset_zamp_sync_data();
// exit;
// }
// }); 3) The SQL queries: -- Clear scheduled actions
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_sync_%';
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_transactions_queue_%';

-- Reset sync status
INSERT INTO wp_options (option_name, option_value, autoload) 
VALUES ('zamp_sync_status', 'ready', 'yes') 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE option_value = 'ready';

-- Clear transaction status meta
DELETE FROM wp_postmeta 
WHERE meta_key IN ('zamp_transaction_status', 'zamp_transaction_date', 'zamp_transaction_error'); Overall, we're hoping to accomplish the following items somehow: Clean up scheduled actions via Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() Clear any scheduled events with wp_clear_scheduled_hook('zamp_process_transactions_event') Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() - Removes all scheduled batch processing tasks Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data() - Removes all sync progress and queue data from the options table","Hi Celina thank meet early confirm Transaction Sync bulk historical Zamp function despite clear zamp relate Scheduled Actions verifying order Zamp Transaction Sync Status successful Calendly link schedule week prefer option clear Zamp tax relate transaction sync record effectively reset item utilize WP CLI Command WP CLI access involve create file similar attached wp-cli-zamp-reset.php store theme use plugin run command wp zamp reset sync run function functions.php attached file run SQL query phpMyAdmin similar tool 2 function run function reset_zamp_sync_data current_user_can('manage_woocommerce return Insufficient permission clean schedule action class_exists('ActionScheduler as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch array zamp transaction sync clean option global $ wpdb $ wpdb->query(""delete $ wpdb->option option_name like zamp_sync_% $ wpdb->query(""delete $ wpdb->option option_name like zamp_transactions_queue_% reset sync status update_option('zamp_sync_status ready clear transaction status meta $ wpdb->query(""delete $ wpdb->postmeta meta_key zamp_transaction_statu zamp_transaction_date zamp_transaction_error return Zamp sync datum completely reset uncomment run comment run add_action('init function current_user_can('manage_woocommerce isset($_GET['reset_zamp_sync echo reset_zamp_sync_data exit 3 SQL query clear schedule action DELETE wp_option option_name like zamp_sync_% DELETE wp_option option_name like zamp_transactions_queue_% reset sync status INSERT wp_option option_name option_value autoload value zamp_sync_status ready yes DUPLICATE KEY update option_value = ready clear transaction status meta DELETE wp_postmeta meta_key zamp_transaction_statu zamp_transaction_date zamp_transaction_error overall hope accomplish follow item clean schedule action zamp_transaction_sync_batch::cleanup_scheduled_action clear schedule event wp_clear_scheduled_hook('zamp_process_transactions_event zamp_transaction_sync_batch::cleanup_scheduled_action Removes schedule batch processing task Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data Removes sync progress queue datum option table"

After reviewing the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin code looking at zamp-tax/includes/admin/transaction-sync/class-zamp-transaction-sync-batch.php , it appears this could be related to multiple items: The following is similar to situations we worked through at TaxJar for WooCommerce. We may need to involve Arlene Cycle's more technical team for database access, depending on what we find during our call today. Issues After Plugin Reinstallation Several things might cause transactions not to sync to Zamp after reinstallation: Orphaned Action Scheduler Tasks : The plugin uses WooCommerce Action Scheduler to queue batch processing tasks After reinstallation, old scheduled actions might still exist in the database, but the code to handle them might have changed These tasks are stored in the WordPress database in the wp_actionscheduler_actions table Stale Transaction Status Metadata : The plugin stores transaction status as post meta ( zamp_transaction_status ) If an order was previously marked as ""Success"", it won't be reprocessed by default After reinstallation, this metadata remains but the actual sync state might be different Incomplete Cleanup of Previous Sync Data : Batch progress data is stored in WordPress options with prefixes: zamp_transactions_queue_ for batch queues zamp_sync_progress_ for progress tracking If reinstallation happens during an active sync, these might remain in an inconsistent state Sync Status Inconsistency : The global sync status is stored in the zamp_sync_status option If this is stuck in 'in_progress' after reinstallation, new syncs might be blocked Clearing Caches and Resetting Queues To resolve these issues after reinstallation, you should: Clear Action Scheduler Queue : The plugin has a built-in method: Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() This calls as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch', array(), self::SCHEDULER_GROUP) You might need to manually trigger this if the reinstallation didn't properly clean up Clean Up Sync Data : Use Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data() to remove all sync progress and queue data This removes all options with prefixes zamp_sync_progress_ and zamp_transactions_queue_ Reset Sync Status : Set the sync status back to 'ready': Zamp_Transaction_Sync::set_sync_status('ready') This allows new syncs to be initiated Clear Transaction Status Metadata (if needed): If you want to force reprocessing of previously synced orders, you might need to clear the zamp_transaction_status post meta This would be a custom SQL query against the post meta table The most reliable approach would be to run a cleanup sequence that: Stops any in-progress syncs Clears all scheduled actions Removes all sync-related options Resets the sync status to 'ready' This would give you a clean slate to start syncing transactions again after reinstallation. —————————————————————————————————————————- 1. Zamp Plugin UI The Zamp plugin itself appears to provide some admin UI for transaction sync operations, but based on the code reviewed, there is no explicit UI button or menu for a full ""reset"" or ""cleanup"" of all sync data and scheduled actions. However: Stopping Sync: There is an AJAX action for stopping sync ( zamp_stop_transaction_sync ), which calls Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() and resets status. If the plugin’s admin UI provides a “Stop Sync” or “Cancel Sync” button, using it will clear scheduled actions and reset the sync status. Starting Sync: Starting a new sync ( zamp_start_transaction_sync ) also calls the cleanup method before creating new batches. So, starting a new sync from the UI should clear out old scheduled actions. No ""Full Reset"" Button: There is no evidence of a UI button to clear all progress, batch queues, or transaction meta in bulk. These are handled in the backend code. 2. WooCommerce Action Scheduler UI WooCommerce (and some plugins) provide an Action Scheduler admin screen at: WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Here, you can view, search, and manually run or delete scheduled actions, including those for Zamp (look for hooks like zamp_process_transactions_batch ). You can manually delete stuck or failed actions from this screen. 3. WordPress Options / Post Meta No UI for Options Table or Post Meta: WordPress does not provide a native UI to delete custom options (like zamp_sync_progress_* , zamp_transactions_queue_* ) or post meta ( zamp_transaction_status ). You would need a plugin like “WP-Optimize”, “Advanced DB Cleaner”, or direct database access for this. 4. Cache Plugins If you are using a caching plugin (e.g., WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache), you can clear the site cache from their UI, but this does not affect Action Scheduler or Zamp sync data. Summary Table What you can do from UI How/Where Stop/cancel sync Zamp plugin admin (if button exists) Start new sync (clears queue) Zamp plugin admin View/delete scheduled actions WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Clear transaction/post meta Not available in default UI Clear plugin options Not available in default UI Clear site cache Cache plugin UI (not related to Zamp sync) If you need a full reset: Use the Zamp UI to stop any running sync. Use the WooCommerce Scheduled Actions UI to delete any stuck Zamp-related actions. For a true “factory reset” (clearing all progress, queues, and post meta), you would need to run code or SQL, or add a custom admin tool.",move pende ahead review Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin code look zamp tax include admin transaction sync class zamp transaction sync batch.php appear relate multiple item following similar situation work TaxJar WooCommerce need involve Arlene Cycle technical team database access depend find today issue Plugin Reinstallation thing cause transaction sync Zamp reinstallation orphan Action Scheduler Tasks plugin use WooCommerce Action Scheduler queue batch processing task reinstallation old schedule action exist database code handle change task store WordPress database wp_actionscheduler_action table Stale Transaction Status Metadata plugin store transaction status post meta zamp_transaction_status order previously mark Success will reprocess default reinstallation metadata remain actual sync state different Incomplete Cleanup Previous Sync Data batch progress datum store WordPress option prefix zamp_transactions_queue batch queue zamp_sync_progress progress track reinstallation happen active sync remain inconsistent state Sync Status Inconsistency global sync status store zamp_sync_status option stick in_progress reinstallation new sync block Clearing Caches Resetting Queues resolve issue reinstallation Clear Action Scheduler Queue plugin build method zamp_transaction_sync_batch::cleanup_scheduled_action call as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch array self::SCHEDULER_GROUP need manually trigger reinstallation properly clean clean Sync datum Use Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data remove sync progress queue datum remove option prefix zamp_sync_progress zamp_transactions_queue Reset Sync Status set sync status ready Zamp_Transaction_Sync::set_sync_status('ready allow new sync initiate Clear Transaction Status Metadata need want force reprocess previously sync order need clear zamp_transaction_status post meta custom SQL query post meta table reliable approach run cleanup sequence Stops progress sync Clears schedule action remove sync relate option reset sync status ready clean slate start sync transaction reinstallation 1 zamp Plugin UI Zamp plugin appear provide admin UI transaction sync operation base code review explicit UI button menu reset cleanup sync datum schedule action stop sync ajax action stop sync zamp_stop_transaction_sync call zamp_transaction_sync_batch::cleanup_scheduled_action reset status plugin admin UI provide Stop Sync Cancel Sync button clear schedule action reset sync status start Sync start new sync zamp_start_transaction_sync call cleanup method create new batch start new sync UI clear old schedule action Reset Button evidence UI button clear progress batch queue transaction meta bulk handle backend code 2 WooCommerce Action Scheduler UI WooCommerce plugin provide Action Scheduler admin screen WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions view search manually run delete schedule action include Zamp look hook like zamp_process_transactions_batch manually delete stuck fail action screen 3 WordPress Options Post Meta ui Options Table Post Meta WordPress provide native UI delete custom option like zamp_sync_progress zamp_transactions_queue post meta zamp_transaction_status need plugin like WP Optimize Advanced DB Cleaner direct database access 4 Cache Plugins cache plugin e.g. WP Super Cache W3 Total Cache clear site cache UI affect Action Scheduler Zamp sync datum Summary Table UI stop cancel sync Zamp plugin admin button exist start new sync clear queue Zamp plugin admin view delete schedule action WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Clear transaction post meta available default UI Clear plugin option available default UI Clear site cache Cache plugin UI relate Zamp sync need reset use Zamp UI stop running sync use WooCommerce Scheduled Actions UI delete stuck zamp relate action true factory reset clear progress queue post meta need run code SQL add custom admin tool

Calculations from Zamp aren't returning tax collected, even with Stripe Tax disabled. Notes from the call: Before Zamp, they were using Stripe Tax's plugin for WooCommerce. Taxes calculate fine with Stripe Tax, but they're listed as a different tax line from what Zamp would look for (state + jurisdiction name combination). They're also using WooCommerce Subscriptions. Zamp-specific steps: They had the correct API token for Zamp, but we replaced it and saved anyway. Nexus states are correctly configured in Zamp and Woo. Tax calcs and transaction sync were enabled. Debug mode was enabled today (6/6/25). Disabled Stripe Tax and placed an order with only Zamp Tax enabled, no tax was calculated. Re-enabled Stripe Tax, and the tax was calculated. They have the default PTC enabled. Addresses appear to be formatted fine. No transactions in Zamp are showing tax collected, although tax was collected. Example is TR-1348 shown in the screenshot below. Order ID TR-1348: The transaction sync from 6/3/25: Reviewing the logs: The 6/3/25 log file shows a bunch of 409/conflict errors, meaning the transaction already exists. There are a few subtotal, shipping, and tax errors, where issues with amounts may occur (but only in 5 out of 100+ orders). The 6/5/25 log file shows a bunch of attempts to start tax calculations, but the addresses only contain ""state"":""AZ"" The log files from today ( 6/6/25 ) appear to show successful tax calcs, but no taxes were shown on orders in Zamp, or test checkout orders (not entirely placed): Address for my test: 1395 S Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 85286 There's a 400 bad_request error at 2025-06-06T13:07:39+00:00 due to: Receiving lineItems and quantity as string values instead of numbers (I think?)

No—Amelia and I were able to find a temporary solution for a tax code that will work for this scenario when utilizing the Zamp API. Amelia will be following up about that shortly! Regarding how to handle this in QuickBooks Online: To my understanding of QuickBooks Online's product and tax settings, it would be best to categorize the product or service item as a Nontaxable item for any of these 3% (or other percentage) fees associated with payment processing. As far as ""non-taxable income"" goes, I believe that would be a separate account (from sales tax) within QuickBooks Online after reading through this resource and this other resource. I'd still recommend that you confirm with QuickBooks Online support to be sure. Regarding using the ""gift card"" code: Yes—that code could be used here as well. Which would be: R_TPP_GIFT-CARD.

The likely best path here would be to create a non-taxable item for credit card fees and then confirm via a test invoice that QuickBooks Online does not calculate tax for the item. If we make a non-taxable item for credit card fees, would it effect the total tax owed if other line items in the invoice are taxable? Or will it be avoided if Quickbooks isn't calculating sales tax on it? In this situation, the item's total amount won't be included in the taxable portion of the sales within Zamp, and it won't affect the tax owed, as Zamp files based on the tax collected. That said, the gross sales associated with the transaction would be slightly different in Zamp (grossed down), as we've discussed in the past.

I've connected with Taryn regarding the sales tax calculation situation for Michigan and confirmed that, while Zamp isn't planning to file sales tax returns in Michigan for Accelerated Tooling, the calculations can be handled separately. This would likely simplify the situation and increase accuracy. First, Zamp can provide the tax rates and calculate local sales taxes in Michigan for WooCommerce. Sales tax should also be collected in Minnesota and Texas within WooCommerce. 1) A quick question—would you like us to add MI for calculations within Zamp? The Accelerated Tooling Team will still be able to file MI sales tax returns, as this is a separate process from these calculations. 2) If they aren't enabled already, could you please also enable Minnesota and Texas for calculations within WooCommerce? We share how to enable calculations here , and each nexus state (MI, MN, and TX) would need to be added to the nexus states section: Please let me know if you have any questions, and I'm also happy to schedule a call if that would be helpful.",Hi Stephanie thank patience connect Taryn sale tax calculation situation Michigan confirm Zamp plan file sale tax return Michigan Accelerated Tooling calculation handle separately likely simplify situation increase accuracy Zamp provide tax rate calculate local sale taxis Michigan WooCommerce sale tax collect Minnesota Texas WooCommerce 1 quick question like add MI calculation Zamp Accelerated Tooling Team able file mi sale tax return separate process calculation 2 enable enable Minnesota Texas calculation WooCommerce share enable calculation nexus state MI MN TX need add nexus state section let know question happy schedule helpful

It's nice to e-meet you! I wanted to see if you could help us turn off the transaction sync to Zamp from the Accelerated Tooling LLC WooCommerce store.

Chris provides us with the QuickBooks Desktop data every month, and we aim to ensure that there are no duplicate transactions. We share how to turn off the transaction sync to Zamp in this article , and it involves unchecking this box: Navigate to WooCommerce —> Settings —> Zamp Tax —> Send Transactions . Questions: 1) Does the above make sense, and is there anything we can help you with here? 2) Are sales tax calculations enabled within WooCommerce? This should be the case as far as we know.

They might switch to Zamp calculations. Using the TaxJar API is inexpensive, and we want to avoid the technical work. They discovered that Alaska doesn't return the FreightTaxable flags in TaxJar. In Alaska, some municipalities calculate tax on shipping, while others do not, depending on the locality. Do you know if Zamp has already gotten this right? If so, they might move over. It's not a huge cost savings, but it would be good to have better accuracy. A feature request: Is there a way to look up a tax rate without a total? Just an address. If the address validation includes fields such as tax rate, freight taxable, etc., this could be useful. He's happy to hop on with product and engineering folks to hear their reasoning and why, etc. This is tied to how their ERP works; it stores a tax jurisdiction with a rate for the ship-to location, and they can't tie it to an order.",note todo bring transaction forward Kyle okay need run Anita explain situation Kyle understand Escalate eng note detail conduct extensive testing July 1st Zamp Zamp filing switch Zamp calculation TaxJar api inexpensive want avoid technical work discover Alaska return FreightTaxable flag TaxJar Alaska municipality calculate tax shipping depend locality know Zamp get right huge cost saving good well accuracy feature request way look tax rate total address address validation include field tax rate freight taxable etc useful happy hop product engineering folk hear reasoning etc tie ERP work store tax jurisdiction rate ship location tie order

If you'd prefer not to set Zamp up as an accounant within QuickBooks Online, would you prefer that we send a CSV reminder email to provide us with a list of the voided invoices and their transaction details?

A few questions: 1) When you have a moment (it can be next week, of course), could you please add Zamp ( integrations@zamp.com ) as an accounant user within your QuickBooks Online account? 2) Would you like us to delete any of these invoices from your Zamp Transactions, or would you prefer that we zero them out? This is a path we should consider for transactions in non-nexus states, as Zamp's Economic Nexus logic will disregard refund transactions, since no US states currently include refunds in their Economic Nexus thresholds.

I am working on Financials and am confused about the estimated tax payment made for April to California. The invoices you pulled from Quickbook were based on his invoices in April, not the payments received from customers for the sales tax collected. I show in April, over $9k in sales tax money was collected in payments. You paid significantly less. When I looked up the invoices numbers you referenced, these invoices were billed in April but not necessarily paid yet. Why weren't the taxes Chuck received in payments paid out for the estimated tax? I am attaching the report I have showing what taxes were collected by Forcible Entry in April. Please advise as they are a cash basis company and I think those tax amounts collected should have been remitted.

ALSO they ended up returning 2 of the 3 Carlas, so part of this transaction is refunded also. 6/14/25 Cindy Olson 4701 Sunnyside Rd Minneapolis, MN 55424-1107 810 820 MN 55424 6/17/25 Bella Rubin 6 Holly Ln Lawrence, NY 11559-1317 United States 310 320 NY 11559 6/20/25 Siobhan Palermo 3016 Avenida Ciruela Carlsbad, CA 92009-2916 United States 320 354.22 CA 92009 6/20/25 Ali Goldberg 327 E 12th St, Apt 1 New York, NY 10003-7249 United States 580 590 NY 10003 6/20/25 Lola Rose 327 E 12th St, Apt 1 New York, NY 10003-7249 United States 270 280 NY 10003 6/20/25 Bella Rubin 6 Holly Ln Lawrence, NY 11559-1317 United States 310 320 NY 11559 6/20/25 Carla Hetland 9380 198th st, B langley, BC V1M3C8 Canada 1470 1512.05 Canada V1M3C8 This was a big order for a production company that was sent to canada. they paid for overnight shipping and were ok with the import costs too.",hi Jess zamp file attach < July Transactions JULY Transaction Date Customer Shipping Address Transaction Subtotal Transaction Total Shipping State Shipping ZIP code note 6/3/25 Nicole Jusino 1158 Palmer Ave Camarillo United States 370 408.85 93010 6/3/25 Abby Cavanaugh 1413 Sam Bass Rd Round Rock TX United States 290 308.12 TX 78681 weird not find transaction square tho find reciept customer send email ask tracking 6/3/25 Bella Panaccione 705 Varsi Pl Santa Clara United States 330 365.27 95050 Ugh realize happen transaction basically click sale tax add $ 10 shipping fee click extra .62 TX sale tax believe catch sorry 6/5/25 Kaitlin Calderwood 297 Eckford St apt 3L Brooklyn NY United States 280 290 NY 11222 6/5/25 Kylie Collins 28078 Sosta Ln Unit 4 Bonita Springs FL 95 105 FL 34135 6/5/25 Daniela Montano 352 Amber Pine St 107 Las Vegas NV 89144 United States 250 260 NV 89144 6/10/25 Daniela Montano 352 Amber Pine St 107 Las Vegas NV 89144 United States 280 290 NV 89144 6/12/25 Addison Vedadi 2900 Connecticut Ave NW Apt 313 Washington DC United States 320 338.55 DC 20008 transaction little funny couple order 3 Carlas wedding transaction carla order pay $ 56.17 overnight package additionally ask small discount try offset cost give 10 elke approve end return 2 3 Carlas transaction refund 6/14/25 Cindy Olson 4701 Sunnyside Rd Minneapolis MN 810 820 MN 55424 6/17/25 Bella Rubin 6 Holly Ln Lawrence NY United States 310 320 NY 11559 6/20/25 Siobhan Palermo 3016 Avenida Ciruela Carlsbad United States 320 354.22 92009 6/20/25 Ali Goldberg 327 e 12th St apt 1 New York NY United States 580 590 NY 10003 6/20/25 Lola Rose 327 e 12th St apt 1 New York NY United States 270 280 NY 10003 6/20/25 Bella Rubin 6 Holly Ln Lawrence NY United States 310 320 NY 11559 6/20/25 Carla Hetland 9380 198th st B langley BC V1M3C8 Canada 1470 1512.05 Canada v1m3c8 big order production company send canada pay overnight shipping ok import cost

So, it should not be run in EST, it should be run in EDT should it not? Correct! In this situation, a time zone-related difference would be a bit different because of the following: Zamp's API receives date stamps (the transactionDate property) in UTC unless the time zone is specified in the request. I can confirm if this is the case if you or your team could share an example API request with me. Zamp then converts the UTC date/time stamp into EST for Florida. The above means that there can still be a slight variance depending on whether the date/time stamp sent to Zamp was in UTC or if it indicated the time zone was in EST. Here's how to indicate if a date/time stamp is in UTC or EST: For UTC, the date/time value would have a 'Z' at the end like this: 2025-06-09T18:40:00 Z For EST, the date/time value would have a time zone on the end of it, such as '-4:00' for EST (EDT, during Daylight Saving Time), such as: 2025-06-09T18:40:00 -04:00 That said, I don't believe time zones are the cause of the larger difference you've noted for Florida here, and I'll share more details below. The cause of the Florida discrepancy here: After digging into this further, I found that the cause of the difference was related to Order ID 229610 because this transaction was created within Zamp as if it should be fully taxable, and $0 tax was collected: For API integrations such as Wired Watts' integration with Zamp, our tax-due estimates are based on what should have been collected via the Zamp API (the taxDue amount). A few questions: 1) Should this transaction be treated as RESALE (wholesale) or something other than fully taxable? 2) If so, does Wired Watts have the ability to update the transaction via the API? We can sort out a path forward for adjusting to this situation once we have more details. I'm also happy to hop on a call with you if that would be helpful!

If the transaction came in at that time, it was May 1st when that person placed their order in that city in the United States. The only discrepancy would be daylight savings… which the United States takes part in. So, it should not be run in EST, it should be run in EDT should it not?

We've confirmed that the tax-due estimate Zamp shared is based on the tax collected from your Shopify store, which includes both in-person POS location sales and online sales. To our understanding, if a business has nexus in a state, sales tax is calculated and collected for in-person locations and online sales. Additionally, Zamp's tax-due estimate includes only the taxes we've seen collected within your Shopify store. I've attached an export of the transactions we've sold to or shipped to customers located in California and New York. It's important to note that the New York filing includes transactions from March 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025, because New York follows a fiscal quarter with a different date range than other states. A couple of quick questions: 1) To review this further and compare directly against Shopify's reporting, could you please share your Shopify store's Collaborator request code ? This code should be under Settings —> Users within your Shopify Admin. The collaborator access code is something separate from Zamp's automatic import of your Shopify transactions and allows us to review orders, sales tax reporting, and tax settings. 2) Also, could you let me know if we have your approval to proceed with After Market's filings this month? We've held the filings to allow time to investigate this and ensure we're all on the same page.",hi Richard thank continue patience confirm tax estimate Zamp share base tax collect Shopify store include person POS location sale online sale understanding business nexus state sale tax calculate collect person location online sale additionally Zamp tax estimate include taxis see collect Shopify store attach export transaction sell ship customer locate California New York important note New York filing include transaction March 1 2025 31 2025 New York follow fiscal quarter different date range state couple quick question 1 review compare directly Shopify reporting share Shopify store Collaborator request code code setting > Users Shopify Admin collaborator access code separate Zamp automatic import Shopify transaction allow review order sale tax reporting tax setting 2 let know approval proceed Market filing month hold filing allow time investigate ensure page

I don't seem to be able to add members, please could you add Angus to the Zamp portal? Sure! I've added Angus as a user to the Ancient + Brave Zamp portal, and an invite was sent to angus@ancientandbrave.earth . If we should add Tom or others to the Ancient + Brave Zamp portal, please let us know either in this email thread or onboarding@zamp.com. Chris - should all wholesale transactions show as RESALE in Zamp, regardless of nexus/non-nexus/certificate exemption status? Yes—all wholesale transactions will show up as RESALE within Zamp, and we'd recommend implementing a process around this regardless of nexus/non-nexus considerations. The reason for the above is that some US states exclude Wholesale/Resale transactions from their economic nexus thresholds, and Zamp has logic in place to account for this, state by state. In terms of letting you know test orders to delete from Zamp, is there a deadline to communicate this to you before they get filed? Yes—we would need to know which transactions to delete (a date range or IDs/names) by the 5th of the month if Zamp is filing sales tax returns for Ancient + Brave, as that is typically the earliest date we would start filing. Can we also see US sales tax in the order in Shopify? Yes—once tax collection is enabled for a state within Shopify, the tax will show up as a line between Subtotal and Total on a Shopify order: Here's an example: I assume I can go ahead and set Ohio up as a state A+B collects tax in on Shopify safely before I go on holiday? Sure, if that works best for you! I'll need to do this before UAT starts, but it makes me nervous that we're using Zamp's live system to test on the test Shopify store - is there not a sandbox we can connect to?

In terms of letting you know test orders to delete from Zamp, is there a deadline to communicate this to you before they get filed? Additionally, in the expected results on the UAT sheet, I've said to check Zamp for US sales tax calcs. Can we also see US sales tax in the order in Shopify?

Also, I'm in the process of writing the testing scripts for the Shopify integration. Are there any particular testing scenarios you think are worth including? We'd recommend testing some basic scenarios here, and other testing depends on the third-party Shopify apps that are planned for implementation: An order shipping to a nexus state (e.g., Ohio) has tax collected. An order to a non-nexus state (not set up to collect tax) does not have tax collected. Orders for wholesale customers do not have tax collected and show up within Zamp as RESALE on the transactions page. If any third-party apps, such as those listed below, are used, we recommend reviewing those orders to ensure the tax amounts match within Zamp and Shopify (we can help if this is not the case or if these apps are planned). Loop - returns & exchanges. ReturnGo AfterShip Outside of the above, everything should be smooth sailing.

A few things: I realized we needed data from 11/1/23 to 12/31/24; we didn't need the October 2023 data, as we didn't file (per Nicole's notes above). The SUM of tax still doesn't match the tax due in the liability report , but that may be fine. I realized that we don't have the source data they're comparing against, so it's challenging to determine how close we are or whether this is the right approach to take. There are some transactions (highlighted in green in the attached file) that were created or updated after we filed for the customer. Although the amount is small, it may make a difference. I didn't see many transactions that had a difference between the Zamp created date and the updated date, meaning it's unlikely there were many updates to the data after we filed. There was one transaction, but it was updated 1 minute after it was created, and that shouldn't matter. This won't account for edited orders or partial refunds in Shopify (as Kyle noted here .) Could the customer be granted an extension, or should we schedule a call to talk about this more? They keep asking for the BigCommerce transactions or source files, but those will not match; we might want to explain that. I'd need more time to review the numbers and the data they're comparing against (we don't have all Nov 2023-Dec 2024 filing amounts uploaded into Zamp, it appears ). cc: @nick @ashleyD - in case either of you has thoughts or ideas.

I've shared this with our team. The tax per state looks good to me and I've already approved it for payments. I also really appreciate the effort you're putting in to make sure everything reconciles correctly - it's important we're only paying taxes we're actually responsible for. Regarding Wholesale transactions : What typically happens on our end is that the customer reaches out letting us know tax was incorrectly applied, and we either have to reimburse them or they short pay the invoice, which then requires us to manually correct the order. Going forward, we'll tighten this up to ensure anything tagged as WholesaleNoTax is properly exempted and doesn't have tax collected. Appreciate your help on all of this - let me know if anything else is needed from our side. Best, Andy",hey Chris thank follow appreciate thorough breakdown support report share team tax state look good approve payment appreciate effort put sure reconcile correctly important pay taxis actually responsible wholesale transaction typically happen end customer reach let know tax incorrectly apply reimburse short pay invoice require manually correct order go forward tighten ensure tag WholesaleNoTax properly exempt tax collect appreciate help let know need well Andy

I've confirmed that after running our temporary workaround method to force the reconciliation between Zamp's tax amounts and Shopify's tax amounts, the estimate sent just a bit ago aligns with the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report for April 2025 when filtering by Shopify Destination states we're filing in this month; I've attached a copy of that export from Shopify. Regarding Wholesale transactions: I've also attached a comparison of a Shopify export (looking for the 'Wholesale' or 'WholesaleNoTax' tags), which shows several transactions tagged with a wholesale tax, that have tax collected and paid without tax refunds. There are about 10 transactions with either of these tags that haven't been paid yet (it looks like they have various payment terms), and one example is #490783 . For the transactions noted above with payment pending and a wholesale tag, will the tax be removed from those Shopify orders, and should we offset this within Zamp?

The estimate was generated after I adjusted for order edits; the work file is attached. There is a difference here due to sales tax rounding in various states, and some due to refunds causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions. The difference/variance is small percentage-wise. Time zone differences are no longer a factor here as this export adjusts for that; this is also possible within the Zamp portal.

To our understanding (and Stripe's), the products (subscription) would be fully taxable in Texas, and the 80% alternate rate wouldn't apply here. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed is up to you, but I wanted to ensure we're on the same page. This was noted on 5/12: On the surface, the Texas sales tax calculation piece is correct to our knowledge for Software as a Service (SaaS), and we'll confirm CT's tax rate for this product type. As soon as we've confirmed these details or have more information to share, we'll follow up immediately. If you wish to categorize your product as Software as a Service (SaaS) within Stripe, that would achieve the goal of charging 80% of the full rate in TX with these codes: txcd_10103000 - Software as a service (SaaS) - personal use txcd_10103001 - Software as a service (SaaS) - business use Zamp's filing service would support the 80% alternate rate if Stripe is categorized with one of the codes noted above.

I’m following up on the tax treatment of your Substack newsletter as a digital good in Texas and Connecticut, as our Tax Research Team shared some additional context and discovered an item specific to Connecticut. In Texas , a Substack newsletter is classified as a digital good, treated as tangible personal property under Texas Tax Code § 151.009 . This means it is subject to the full sales tax rate, similar to physical goods, and not at the reduced 80% taxable threshold that applies to certain services like information or data processing services ( Texas Tax Code § 151.351 ). Substack's digital newsletter is a product, not a service. Specifically, downloadable articles (txcd_10303000) and non-downloadable articles ( txcd_10304102 ) are taxable sales in Texas. In Connecticut , digital goods are also considered tangible personal property and are generally subject to the standard 6.35% sales tax rate, as outlined in Special Notice 2018(8) . However, after further review, Connecticut exempts sales of newspapers, whether in physical or electronic form, from sales tax under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-412(114) . As a result, both downloadable ( txcd_10303000 ) and non-downloadable ( txcd_10304102 ) newsletter articles are exempt from sales tax in Connecticut. It’s worth noting that some platforms, like Stripe, may not distinguish between electronically supplied goods or services in their general categories, such as the Stripe Tax code txcd_10000000 , which is currently configured. This means that if the path to not distinguish between downloadable and non-downloadable is taken, Stripe and Zamp would treat Citrinitas' newsletter product as taxable in both CT and TX.

Yes, an online newsletter is a digital good within both states, but the taxation varies (see below). 2.  Are digital goods in Texas fully taxable or taxed at a reduced rate or threshold of 80%, like SaaS is? Digital goods in Texas are taxed like tangible personal property. TX Letter Ruling 20005359L indicates that digital products are tangible personal property as defined in TX Tax Code § 151.009 (""'Tangible personal property' means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched or that is perceptible to the senses in any other manner, and, for the purposes of this chapter, the term includes a computer program and a telephone prepaid calling card.""). The 80% tax situation applies only to information services and data processing services ( TX Tax Code § 151.351 ). ""Information service"" is defined as ""furnishing general or specialized news or other current information"" unless it is furnished to a physical, printed newspaper licensed by the Federal Communications Commission ( TX Tax Code § 151.0038(1) ). Substack's digital newsletter is a product, ​not a service​. The service of providing information to a newspaper is different from the digital newspaper/newsletter that is produced and distributed. As long as Substack categorizes its product as a digital newsletter (rather than some sort of service), it has to treat it as a digital good. Therefore, in Texas, R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS for downloadable articles and R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS_NEWSPAPER for non-downloaded articles are both taxable sales (which we have correct in our system). 3 - Would a digital good be considered fully taxable in CT or taxed at a 1% rate? Special Notice 2018(8) indicates that digital goods are included in the definition of tangible personal property and are taxed at the 6.35% rate effective Oct. 2019. However, sales of newspapers, whether sold as physical copies or electronically accessed or transferred are exempt from sales tax ( Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-412(114) ). Therefore, in Connecticut, R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS for downloadable articles and R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS_NEWSPAPER for non-downloaded articles are both exempt sales (which we have correct in our system). I also want to point out that Stripe does not distinguish between an electronically supplied good or service at the ""general"" category that appears on Substack's support article . But for tax purposes, it is a vital distinction. It's up to the customer to classify their product correctly. In my opinion, a newsletter is a digital good, not a service.

We talked about this internally and wanted to share the details previously noted by our Tax Research and Content Team and how we would view this situation. Overall, Zamp understands and interprets that Citrinitas' offerings would be fully taxable at the full rate for Connecticut and Texas. The above interpretation is due to Citrinitas' offering being viewed as a digital good, separate from Software products/services, where the TX 80% reduced rate rule applies; this is also our view of the 1% rate for CT . From our understanding, Substack allows writers to share information via written format, podcasts, and videos. All three are digital products, or as Maine calls them, ""products transferred electronically."" This fits with the support article that advises using ""General—Electronically Supplied Services."" It seems like Citrinitas has some articles that can be downloaded and some that cannot. The ability to download matters in some states. Therefore, if they ​do not​ want to differentiate between which articles can be downloaded and which cannot, they can use R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS (which will tax both types of articles). Chris R Note - this is currently what the existing Stripe Tax code maps to, within Zamp. If they do want to make the distinction between downloadable and non-downloadable, these tax codes can be used: The Stripe Tax code for downloadable articles: txcd_10303000 The Stripe Tax code for non-downloadable articles is: txcd_10304102 Next steps: That being said, we will triple-check with our Tax Research team to confirm this interpretation and for any additional context that comes with our advisory services.

We talked about this internally and wanted to share the details previously noted by our Tax Research and Content Team and how we would view this situation. Overall, Zamp understands and interprets that Citrinitas' offerings would be fully taxable at the full rate for Connecticut and Texas. The above interpretation is due to Citrinitas' offering being viewed as a digital good, separate from Software products/services, where the TX 80% reduced rate rule applies; this is also our view of the 1% rate for CT . From our understanding, Substack allows writers to share information via written format, podcasts, and videos. All three are digital products, or as Maine calls them, ""products transferred electronically."" This fits with the support article that advises using ""General—Electronically Supplied Services."" It seems like Citrinitas has some articles that can be downloaded and some that cannot. The ability to download matters in some states. Therefore, if they ​do not​ want to differentiate between which articles can be downloaded and which cannot, they can use R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS (which will tax both types of articles). Chris R Note - this is currently what the existing Stripe Tax code maps to, within Zamp. If they do want to make the distinction between downloadable and non-downloadable, these tax codes can be used: The Stripe Tax code for downloadable articles: txcd_10303000 The Stripe Tax code for non-downloadable articles is: txcd_10304102 Next steps: That being said, we are going to triple-check with our Tax Research team to confirm this interpretation and for any additional context that comes with our advisory services. As soon as we have more details to share, we'll follow up right away.

I've imported the credit memo, and that change is now reflected in our tax-due estimate. Regarding #2 —yes, that's correct! These would be related to any credit memos not sourced from Shopify and are processed within QuickBooks Online. Below is the updated tax-due estimate, but first, I wanted to share some details about the difference for Colorado. Regarding Colorado: The $42.60 difference for Colorado is related to a refund transaction (#1899), causing the tax amount for the Denver, CO local jurisdictions within the CO filing to become negative. This applies to the City, County, and special tax (e.g., transportation or facilities-related districts). God's True Cashmere didn't have enough sales in these jurisdictions throughout April 2025 to cover the full refunded tax amount. A portion of the refunded tax is excluded from the filing because the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) doesn't allow negative amounts in local jurisdictions when filing Colorado returns; the majority of states don't allow this. In a situation like this, Zamp would need to file the sales tax return in CO as it is or after removing the refund transaction. As an exception, we can move this refund transaction into the May 2025 filing period to be processed in June 2025 if you'd like us to. Please note that we'll need to know how to proceed here by the end of the day (EST) tomorrow, May 15th, 2025 , to file for God's True Cashmere in a timely manner. If we cannot proceed or don't hear back, the filings will need to move into our overdue filings queue and could be subject to state-applied penalties & interest. Please let us know if you have any questions! Here's the updated tax-due estimate: 🗓️ Returns due in May In the table below, we have provided the estimated tax due for God's True Cashmere, LLC.

I'm part of the Technical Success Team here at Zamp, and we've been investigating the differences noted for the November 2025 filing period. After further review, it appears that Shopify Tax collected amounts for the October 2024 filing period (10/1/24-10/31/24) were used for the comparison on the 'Zamp-Filings' sheet of the file you shared. I've attached a modified version of your XLSX file with an extra sheet showing the November 2024 Shopify tax collected amounts on their own; this is on the 'Z Shopify Review - Nov 24' sheet. The 'Zamp-Filings' sheet has been updated with those amounts. That said, we're still seeing close to a 12% difference between Zamp and Shopify for Oklahoma and Rhode Island ; those are highlighted in blue. In both of these states, Zamp filed overdue returns in January 2025, while they were due in December 2024. The differences here are due to penalties & interest assessed by the state. The differences that are under or within ~2% are very likely due to timely filing discounts, rounding, or time zone differences; we share more info about that here . We also reviewed your account for known third-party apps (such as Loop, which Zamp accounts for and appears to be appropriately configured) or edge-case scenarios that might cause differences. A quick question: Which Shopify Report do you use to reconcile and compare? In our Comparison, we used the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report because Velvet Caviar uses Shopify Tax for the calculations. We've found this report to typically align closely with Zamp (with a few differences noted above). It also appears that you're likely using this report, but we wanted to confirm.

When registering in California, the state flagged the original nexus start date as potentially being after the point of crossing the economic threshold and they wanted Velvet Caviar to reassess this information. After further conversation with Paul, the nexus start date was reassessed to March 1, 2023. This was resolved in February after the Q4 2024 deadline resulting in penalties and interest associated with the filing. This is the difference you are seeing for this period. We are reviewing these periods and will keep you updated. Thank you! In New York, you are on a quarterly prepayment filing frequency so the majority of the tax had already been submitted as ""Advance payments"". You can find this on your New York Q4 2024 return on page 8. I hope that this helps to clarify and please let me know if you have any further questions! In the meantime, we will work to look closer at November.

I also took another pass at reconciling the Shopify sales report. I understand there may be some timing differences, but I wanted to flag a few discrepancies and get your input: California Q4 shows a large discrepancy 129K paid vs 115K on the report-do you have any insight into this? November filings across multiple states also seem off. Was there a specific issue that month that could be contributing to these variances? Could it also be tied to the California Q4 discrepancy? Just a heads up: the Shopify report I'm using includes returns in the tax totals. Lastly, regarding New York : it looks like we began filing monthly starting in December, but the Q4 NY filing totals only show about $11K-did we potentially miss a month? Let me know what you think when you get a chance and if it would be easier to just jump on a call. Thanks -- Israel Vaca Financial Controller | Velvet Caviar inc.

So far, I see very few Loop transactions that overstate the tax due because we see Loop exchange transactions without tax listed (which would mean they probably have the Loop Discount disabled, which is what we want). https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2sou8001uto8m6dh2m8ykj/transactions?search=EXC&date=2025-01-01%7E2025-05-08&limit=100 That said, there are ~15-18 transactions since we started filing (8/1/23-5/8/25) where Loop transactions associated with exchanges have tax associated with them; these would typically cause duplicate tax. We'll need to dig into this further, but these can also be adjusted for within future periods. https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/5644-find-shopify-loop-exchange-transactions-with-tax-collected-v2?company=clv2sou8001uto8m6dh2m8ykj&start=2023-08-01&end=2025-05-08 We'll also need to manually review their Shopify transactions vs. Zamp transactions because they're using Avalara for tax calculations in Shopify , which is trickier to investigate. (We don't have the Shopify US Taxes report to work off of, just the 'taxes' report , which I'll need to review more.) That said, Zamp's estimate is under the total tax collected for April 2025 in the 'Taxes Report', but that's likely due to filing frequency differences and time zones.",@ashleyd look time today tomorrow far loop transaction overstate tax Loop exchange transaction tax list mean probably Loop Discount disable want say ~15 18 transaction start file 8/1/23 5/8/25 loop transaction associate exchange tax associate typically cause duplicate tax need dig adjust future period need manually review Shopify transaction vs. Zamp transaction Avalara tax calculation Shopify tricky investigate Shopify Taxes report work taxis report need review say Zamp estimate total tax collect April 2025 Taxes Report likely file frequency difference time zone

We'd need to use: The United States sales tax report and the Transactions version of that report. I'd usually run the Shopify forced recon script here, and we still could, but I did that already for this customer before filing. We'd likely want to look at the results of Variance reviewing and j urisdiction-level queries to see if anything stands out. Suppose they have a bunch of refunds in various states, making the amount in the jurisdiction-level query negative. If the amount is negative and ends up being close to the difference here, that is likely the culprit.

I just saw this notification and dug in since we definitely don't have $100k USD in PA transactions. But I think I found the issue 😊 What I believe is happening is that things are importing with a translation issue. If we're using the foreign currency, then the integration is multiplying by the currency conversion rate instead of what we should be doing, which is dividing. As an example, Invoice 6448 should total $18,000 USD but is showing up as ~$36,800 USD in Zamp (see attached screenshots). If I take the QBO canadian amount of $25,734.33 CAD, and divide it by $18,000 USD, that implies a 1.429685 exchange rate. But $25,734.33 * 1.429685 = $36,791.99 which is what is showing up in Zamp.

In our analysis, we have found transactions that are not being remitted as they should.  I'd like to set up some time to understand why Zamp is not reporting and sending sales tax on the following Shop Channel Transactions and what needs to be done to correct this.  I could not find a way within Zamp to set up a time to discuss these issues so I am reaching out via email. Following are the general areas that I would like to discuss with you: Shopify Payments - the majority of the transactions are flowing through to Zamp with a few exceptions.  For example, transaction ID 6005407449255 - Shopify shows $2.56 in sales tax collected but Zamp did not report these taxes. TikTok - This looks like an integration we may need to add as no TikTok transactions are being reported.  How do we go about getting this Channel added in Zamp? Shop Cash / Shopify Payments - when a customer uses Shop Cash, Zamp is not remitting the sales tax - Is this a separate integration?  Why would this be?  For example, transaction ID 6005255405735 - Shopify shows $6.24 in sales tax collected but Zamp did not report these taxes. How are returns handled?  Do they just flow into the next month's reporting? How do we go about getting the previous month's sales tax reported/sent to the proper governmental authorities? I have copied Sam Bauman, David Protein's Director of Finance, if you need any authorization to speak to me on his account.  Please suggest a few times when we could discuss the above or send me a link to select a time to meet.

I went through all transactions with a note attached and was actually surprised at how many were accurate . For example, 74075 shows all the correct logic, following best accounting principles: - Taxable transaction - Refunded transaction - Recreated transaction as exempt On the other hand, the exact same scenario is a bust for some reason (74018): - Taxable transaction - Refunded transaction - Recreated transaction as exempt - Refunded the recreated transaction as exempt. For some of the other orders where there was an adjustment/change, I noticed we didn't create the transaction with the appropriate change, or it was just left as refunded. This was the case for 140162 and 140425. I had corrected these. In either case, the guys are going to kick a new notice your way that is mathematically sound to the transaction exports I did from BigCommerce. I'm going to take these issues to my write-up for the integration developers. Thanks!

I wrote something to handle a comparison where the order notes field was used to look at the records in Zamp. It produces a trail to show all coinciding transactions produced on our end. This also works as a precursor to looking back at old records from before we talked about using the order notes field. The ""Difference"" log line is a comparison of the ""Order Total (Inc Tax)"" from a BigCommerce orders export to the Zamp net total after all the records. There are some examples further down the trail where the difference is more apparent. I think there were a total of 14 orders across SSM and PSP that have order notes from April. This work will continue into the end of the week, when I hope to clear getting a new notice your way from our team.

No—I was referring to a slightly different configuration (and likely UI updates) or checkout flow to ensure address validation doesn't prevent the customer from continuing through checkout.

From our standpoint, the /addresses validation is correct as it was initially built and needs a configuration tweak. Zamp uses more data sources with higher accuracy overall, or at least simply a different way of processing the data (From the Google Maps API), which can result in variance with other address validation services.

Our Engineering Team told me that Zamp viewed the address as invalid because of a data and geolocation quality indicator we have in place for address validation. Here's a bit of detail: Zamp's /addresses API endpoint is currently configured to allow only rooftop or parcel address precision confidence levels, and we receive a zip9 response for this address, but we also received an indicator that DPV = 'Y' This happens because Zamp utilizes a different address validation solution than Google, with a broader mix of data. We found a strategy here that would allow addresses with a DPV value of Y for this scenario and cast a wider net for valid addresses, an indicator tied to the data existing within a USPS dataset. We've passed along a feature request that would add the DPV item noted above to the validation ruleset, and we hope to have it released in the future. Once this is released, we'll be sure to follow up!",hi Ethan quick follow Engineering Team tell Zamp view address invalid datum geolocation quality indicator place address validation bit detail Zamp /addresses api endpoint currently configure allow rooftop parcel address precision confidence level receive zip9 response address receive indicator DPV = Y happen Zamp utilize different address validation solution Google broad mix datum find strategy allow address DPV value Y scenario cast wide net valid address indicator tie datum exist USPS dataset pass feature request add DPV item note validation ruleset hope release future release sure follow

The good news is that our filing team will be able to file these returns on time, and there will be no late charges from the states. We keep these dates in mind as we work through various situations, and we'll communicate this more clearly going forward. For Illinois and Iowa filings, we have until 5/15/2025 to file on time, ideally we would file before that date. We looked into this further and found the following items contributed to the differences here: For Iowa , we found that Transaction ID 144 had a date of 4/29/ 26 instead of 4/29/ 25 , causing the transaction to be placed in a future filing period. We have updated this, and we've made improvements to prevent situations like this from occurring in the future. For Illinois , we found that the difference you noted was due to our tax-due estimate automatically accounting for the Illinois timely filing discount (also known as the 'Retailer's discount'), and that estimated amount is $398.00 . The IL Retailer's discount is applied when filing on time and is 1.75% of the sales tax collected. Please let us know if you have any questions.

To ensure we're on the same page, are we wondering why the 'Tax Collected' and 'Tax Due' values differ? If the above is the case, I've outlined our findings for the states noted below. Colorado - This difference is due to the CO's timely filing discount. Florida - this difference is also due to a timely filing discount for FL. Illinois - This is another difference due to the timely filing discount for IL. Washington—This difference is caused by the Business & Occupation gross receipts tax (0.471% of all transactions) due when filing sales tax returns in CO, which is 34.97. If the above helps and makes sense here, it appears that adjustments won't be needed for the April 2025 filing period, we can skip the adjustment imports this month, and send the tax-due estimate out, today.

I checked in with our Head of Filing, who noted that if we cannot access the Shipping address details in Target's order exports and sales tax report exports, we can place the Target Plus transactions into a zip code within that state. Ultimately, our primary recommendation is to either implement a third-party tool like Acenda (or something similar, but this isn't an endorsement) or contact Target Plus Seller Support via the Target Plus portal to find a way to obtain an export from Target Plus with the shipping address data. Working with Target Plus Seller Support is likely the best path forward here. It may involve submitting a ticket to them (or emailing them) via the 'Support' section on the left-hand side of the portal, as during our call, we saw that the 'support' option was some chatbot. When you have a moment, could you please share a CSV file with the Target Plus transaction data listed by state?

We reviewed the Target Plus file and found that while it does contain some of the information we need, it's missing the Ship To Address details. To import and use the data in sales tax filings, Zamp would need at least the Ship To Zip code , or the Ship To City and Ship To State . Also, Zamp would need every row in the CSV file to contain amounts (discounts, subtotal, etc.) and a transaction date. Unfortunately, we haven't had to export data from Target Plus yet, as we haven't received this kind of request in the past. If we find or think of any customers also selling through Target Plus, we'll ask them how they approach it. That said, we did some research here and this is what we've found: The Target Plus Reports do not contain the shipping addresses. A third-party tool like Acenda could obtain an export that includes the Shipping address ( ChannelEngine and other tools don't appear to have this ability, but there may be others). We don't specifically endorse any tool here, as this is new to us. It might be best to contact Target Plus Seller Support via their portal using the help/support features. Target Guest Relations may also be able to direct you to the correct department by calling 1-800-440-0680. Based on our research (what we can find online), it is not easy to get the data Zamp would need for Target Seller Plus sales. If you can see a way to obtain the city and state for the orders within Target Plus, we could use that data, but otherwise, it appears to be tricky to accomplish this. If you'd like, we're also happy to schedule a call with this link to share your screen and see if we can find any way around Target Plus' limitations here. If a time on my calendar won't work for you, please let me know what days and times work for you, and I'll check with other folks at Zamp to see who might be available. Please let us know if you have any questions!",Hi Sarita thank patience review Target plus file find contain information need miss ship address detail import use datum sale tax filing Zamp need ship zip code ship City Ship State Zamp need row csv file contain amount discount subtotal etc transaction date unfortunately export datum Target Plus receive kind request past find think customer sell Target Plus ask approach say research find Target plus Reports contain shipping address party tool like Acenda obtain export include shipping address ChannelEngine tool appear ability specifically endorse tool new good contact Target plus Seller Support portal help support feature Target Guest Relations able direct correct department call 1- base research find online easy data Zamp need Target Seller Plus sale way obtain city state order Target Plus use datum appear tricky accomplish like happy schedule link share screen find way Target plus limitation time calendar will work let know day time work check folk Zamp available let know question

We found a few root causes related to the difference here, and I've outlined those below. Refund Transactions with discounts where the tax refunded was lower in Zamp than Shopify—our engineering team is monitoring this, and an improvement is in progress. Order Edits to Shopify orders via Shopify's built-in return/exchange functionality. Shopify's APIs don't expose much of this to Zamp, and what we've seen in the past has been inconsistent and inaccurate. Our engineering team has this on their list to explore solutions for the future. A couple of edge case-related Shopify voided/canceled orders. This is also on our engineering team's radar. Please note that Shopify's tax amounts (within the US Sales Tax Report ) have changed a bit since the initial email: We've adjusted for the differences here and will send you an updated tax-due estimate. For now and until the features/improvements noted above are released, we'll account for these scenarios before sending the tax-due estimate in the future.

After looking into the order examples you shared, the differences with these orders occur due to a form of order editing that uses Shopify's native (but newer) return/exchange functionality. We can tell this is the case when orders show removed/added items or note 'partially refunded' OB47903 From looking at the transactions page below, we show a remaining $9 for sales tax, but Shopify shows $7.92, so we're off a bit here; that's likely part of the cause (or all.) https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB47903&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 This is likely related to this in-progress feature request (issue..): https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/40979248/card_tables/cards/8390180624 ———————————- OB50115 This one looks like an order edit, but it also uses Shopify's return functionality. We don't even have the correct tax amount because of the order edit (removing an item directly in Shopify's UI): The Zamp transactions: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB50115&timezone=US/Local&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 $0 for a return/refund and $26.56 for tax. ———————————————————————— OB49868 This one is a voided/canceled order that is related to a different, known, issue.

We should run the Shopify forced reconciliation script here: https://github.com/zamptax/zamp-technical-success/tree/main/utility/scripts/shopify_forced_recon_offset Then, after we allow an hour for the forced reconciliation adjustment transactions to be factored in, compare the Zamp notice amounts (the MB query here ) against the US taxes report to see if they're closer.

I investigated this and found that Shopify support is correct here as far as I can tell, unless tax collection was never enabled for California. It seems that Shopify either defaulted to collecting taxes when an in-person CA location was added, or it was turned on at some point. Currently, the CA tax collection appears to be disabled per this Shopify taxes report. This appears to be related to the NC Crane AG location's address in San Luis Obispo County, which can be found in Shopify here . Shopify also shares a bit of detail about this here ,  when viewing this location in Shopify and on the ' Manage tax liability ' page here (also shown below): The tax collection for San Luis Obispo County and the city of CA could be correct based on the various tax rules within CA, as that is where this POS location is currently listed. We share more details about this in our California Sales Tax Guide here . We would call this intrastate sales tax sourcing, but as Shopify notes , it's sometimes called 'hybrid origin' sourcing. This type of tax collection involves collecting the California state tax, the county and local taxes of the in-person location, and the city and district taxes associated with the shipping address. The above would be correct if Semaine Health does have a physical location within San Luis Obispo County, is registered to collect and file taxes in CA, and the ' Hybrid-Origin ' tax setting was selected for CA: Zamp's sales tax API would calculate similarly if we knew that Semaine Health had this exact location. If you're not registered to collect in CA (we don't see that listed as such in Zamp) and aren't filing CA returns outside of Zamp, we recommend refunding the taxes collected to your customers if you haven't done so already. Suppose the CA tax wasn't enabled and the 'Hybrid-Origin' option wasn't selected. In that case, we'd recommend you continue to escalate this with Shopify for further investigation (based on our understanding of Shopify's settings and documentation). I understand that the above is a lot of information, which can be tricky (especially when explaining it to a customer). We're happy to hop on a call to discuss this sometime if you'd like! Do you think the above helps answer the situation here? If not, please let us know; we'll clarify!

Unfortunately, the 'Criquet Shirts' Shopify Store access still appears pending. This is very strange, and as far as I can tell, you're doing everything correctly. Here's what we see: Is this effecting our filing process? Yes—we're currently holding Criquet Apparel's filings until we can run a bulk sync to update some items associated with Criquet's Shopify transactions. This is due to some changes made on Shopify's end, which required updating our integration. The good news is that we're on top of this and will be able to file on time for you. To file timely, we need to ensure your sales tax filings are moving into our process by Monday, 5/12/25. If needed, we have some additional time past that date, but we're hoping to keep things as efficient as possible. ——————————————————————————- Next steps: 1) Can you hop on a quick call about this so that we can screenshare? Or could you reach out to Shopify Support? I'd love to and am happy to help figure this out. Sometimes, we see delays in Shopify access making its way over to Zamp's partner account, but that's usually no more than a few hours. 2) Alternatively, could you follow the steps below to add the read_locations permission that the Zamp app now needs?

Based on this article , Shopify Tax won't calculate taxes for an order if it contains one or more products with a tax rate override. However , it may work if the 'charge tax on this product' box is checked or unchecked. It might be a good idea to try setting these up as a shipping profile or a custom flat-rate option instead. That said, Zamp won't know how to treat these products (line items within an order) as shipping because our Shopify integration uses the order-level 'shipping' amount details to automatically handle shipping taxability; we don't currently have a shipping tax code due to this. If no tax is collected, Zamp will not remit tax to the state DOR, and that portion of the transaction(s) would be excluded from the filing. If tax is collected, we'll categorize it in our filings according to the proper jurisdictions, as most states only require shipping to be grouped with Gross Sales. Setting the taxability of these shipping products manually could work if they are marked as tax-exempt. However, we wouldn't want to apply a tax override (rate) here, because Shopify likely won't collect tax on the order. This should work with Zamp. Ultimately, I recommend checking in with Shopify Plus Support to confirm the best path and behavior when using Shopify Tax.

Most of my availability is in the afternoon (EST), but I can adjust my schedule if a morning time slot is better. Is there an API limit that is silently enforced? If so what is that limit? There is an API rate limit, but it shouldn't be silently enforced. Our API rate limit was recently increased by our engineering team last week and should now be 500 requests per minute. Also could you explain why it's returning so many taxes records for a single line item? Sure! This happens because a taxes object is returned for each tax jurisdiction (state, county, district, etc.), and this occurs for each line item within a transaction. The jurisdiction ""type"" (which can vary from one state to the next) is indicated by the jurisdictionDivision property's value within the object. How do I correlate these back together? Do I sum up for a given line item? This is a good question! In a situation like this, it would likely be best to sum the taxDue amount for each lineItemId if there are multiple line items; otherwise, the taxDue value above the taxes array could be used if there's only a single line item. Regarding the $0 tax due returned for this calculation: This happened in this request's instance because Zamp currently treats line items with the general digital products tax code (R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS) as tax-exempt in Virginia. A way to determine if this is the case is if the taxDue amount in the Zamp calculation response is 0 and the taxableAmount is also 0. I'm also happy to take a look at additional examples. As I can in the morning, I'll review some API calls sent to Zamp for the test account.",hi Ethan thank response course let use link schedule tomorrow availability afternoon EST adjust schedule morning time slot well api limit silently enforce limit api rate limit silently enforce api rate limit recently increase engineering team week 500 request minute explain return taxis record single line item sure happen taxis object return tax jurisdiction state county district etc occur line item transaction jurisdiction type vary state indicate jurisdictiondivision property value object correlate sum give line item good question situation like likely good sum taxdue lineItemId multiple line item taxdue value taxis array single line item $ 0 tax return calculation happen request instance Zamp currently treat line item general digital product tax code r_dig_digital product tax exempt Virginia way determine case taxdue Zamp calculation response 0 taxableamount 0 happy look additional example morning review api call send Zamp test account

I've attached a few files for your review, along with the tax-due estimate: Per our usual process, the 'shopify_orders_export_1-edited' file is the source file for accounting for the edited and voided orders. The ' Ravella - Shopify Edit and Void Adjustments ' file is the adjustments file imported into Zamp to account for this. The 'RAVELLA Zamp Export' file contains all the transactions used for the underlying estimates and filings within Zamp. A quick note about the differences you'll see in the last file vs. the tax-due estimate: The tax-due estimate has an amount that is very much an estimate, which does not fully account for all of the CA prepayments already made (our engineering team has in-progress improvements to better account for this), and here's the breakdown of those payments: The total tax collected was $18,116.00 . The January 2025 prepayment was $6,552.00 . The February 2025 prepayment was $7,709.00 . The remaining should be closer to $3,855 . For Washington, $183.94 is attributed to WA's B&O (gross receipts) tax, due when filing returns but not collected from customers. The other states' differences are minor and within the % margin for rounding, timely filing discounts, and other state-specific tax logic. We weren't able to account for refunds that caused negative amounts in local jurisdictions in the past, but we are still tracking this and plan to work that into the May 2025 filing for April 2025.

Christine let me know that you called, but I was on a call at that time. I'll answer your questions below, and I'm happy to hop on a call sometime if that would be helpful. What I thought was happening is that we overpaid sales tax at the beginning so this was the credits being applied. Is this correct? Yes—this is correct! There were duplicate transactions between a manual CSV import and a QuickBooks Online integration. If so, why are we not taking the full credit for the amount owed each period? Or is it something different? The plan we discussed previously (correct me if I'm wrong, Sadh) is that we would adjust for 10% of the overpaid sales tax each month to prevent sudden changes in Gross Sales and Tax Due amounts from month to month. Another reason here is that some states don't have a tax due amount when we're filing or a filing is not due. I hope this helps!",Hi Nicole welcome thank reach Christine let know call time answer question happy hop helpful think happen overpay sale tax beginning credit apply correct yes correct duplicate transaction manual csv import QuickBooks Online integration take credit owe period different plan discuss previously correct wrong Sadh adjust 10 overpay sale tax month prevent sudden change Gross Sales Tax amount month month reason state tax file filing hope help

We'll need to investigate further, but we'll likely want to disconnect the current Amazon integration with Zamp because we have that sales data syncing separately. If the Amazon data flows into Shopify, we won't need the Amazon connection, as Zamp will handle the transactions from either source. Within Zamp, we'll always view transactions from Amazon (either the direct integration or Shopify) as $0 tax to ensure that tax is not remitted twice because Amazon collects and remits as a marketplace facilitator. The good news is that this won't cause any tax duplication but may cause duplicate amounts within Pacagen's Gross Sales amounts. However, we can quickly help sort that out. A few questions: 1) Do we know when this change was made to bring Amazon transactions into Shopify? Was it effective on 4/8/2025? 2) Was this change applied to historical (before X date) data in any way? 3) Could you or the team share examples of Shopify Order IDs synced to Shopify from Amazon? I've found a few, but I'd like to be sure. The examples I found are: #37965 #37961 #37911",hi Liz thank share need investigate likely want disconnect current Amazon integration Zamp sale datum sync separately Amazon datum flow Shopify will need Amazon connection Zamp handle transaction source Zamp view transaction Amazon direct integration shopify $ 0 tax ensure tax remit twice Amazon collect remit marketplace facilitator good news will cause tax duplication cause duplicate amount Pacagen Gross Sales amount quickly help sort question 1 know change bring Amazon transaction Shopify effective 4/8/2025 2 change apply historical x date datum way 3 team share example Shopify Order id sync shopify Amazon find like sure example find 37965 37961 37911

What report am I supposed to be looking at? and what report do you use? This is a tricky question to answer, but generally, the Shopify US Taxes report you shared is the better report to start with. That being said, there will almost always be some differences (usually 1-2% but under 5%) between Shopify and Zamp; we share more information about that in this article . The differences are usually caused by rounding, timely filing discounts, or differences in time zone handling (Zamp adjusts for each state's specific time zone). Zamp doesn't use a Shopify Report to build our filings and ingest sales data because we use the data provided by Shopify's API. If we need to reference something in Shopify for a tax-related report, we will generally look at the US Taxes Report. When did you loose access to the Shopify store? Thanks for the access code! I just sent a request over. Unfortunately, we're unsure when the access was lost because Shopify hasn't shown us the date. This is an access that can auto-expire after 90-days. We've started some conversations with our engineering team to find ways to prevent this from happening.

They confirmed that if you had no sales after the February 2025 returns were filed, then you can contact the states in which you are filing monthly returns and close out the accounts as of 2/28. On the spreadsheet you provided, there were 26 states you said were $0 filings and you were going to close out. Out of these 26, all of the states were monthly except for New Jersey. We are showing that New Jersey has a quarterly filing. We recommend filing one last return here for the quarter, and then you can contact the state to close out the sales tax account. Our team also confirmed that we can mark New York as the final return. In order to close out the account for New York, you'll still need to contact the state after the final return has been filed. Regarding the payment for the Zamp services, if you prefer to wire transfer you can do this in one transaction. Currently, there are 2 invoices due for the amount of $4,032.22 so the total payment that we need you to wire is $8,064.44. Attached are the wire instructions.

At the same time, it should be accurate. That is one area we're less familiar with, although we're learning more as we can. Zamp's Shopify integration depends upon the Shopify API instead of Shopify's reporting for sales tax details, which we're more familiar with. If you'd like to take the 'Taxes' amount as the source of truth here, it would change our approach, and we'll need to import some additional transactions to arrive at the higher amount.

Good morning and happy Monday! I am following up with a few important updates for Zamp related to the tax filings for March transactions. Here are important updates: Now that I understand that Zamp cannot close states for Nisolo, I've updated the ""Actions Needed by Zamp"" direction by state in column D of the attached spreadsheet, titled ""4.7.25 Update to 4.2.25 Copy March Transactions Zamp Nisolo Follow Up Direction By State"" and the updates can be seen on the ""2.0 Revised…"" tab. There are 10 states that we need for Zamp to take action on. These 10 states are listed at the top of the ""2.0 Revised…"" tab in the spreadsheet. Reuben & I will focus on closing all of the others in green without Zamp support given Zamp cannot help close the states. For the 5 states that need past taxes paid for, refer to the tab ""Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" for the total amount owed in each state. Also, note that the ""Order Data"" requested by Chris for each state for the relevant time ranges where we found past collected tax have all been attached to this email as hard copies, which show the orders within each individual state. Also attached to this email is a spreadsheet that shows all historical sales and taxes collected by month by year for each state (this is the sales data, not the individual orders) I tried to highlight on each tab in teal any states where there was unpaid, collected tax, and I do not think you'll need this spreadsheet. However, note that the ""Prior tax to be paid"" in column B on the ""Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" tab of the ""4.7.25 Update…"" spreadsheet corresponds with the data from the ""Shopify Sales by Month 2019 by Shipping Region sales_2019-01-01_2019-12-31 (1)"" spreadsheet. This data in Column B is what we want to make sure gets paid by state in the March transaction filings. Note, there is a discrepancy between the totals in that spreadsheet vs. what you would find in each individual state (order data) spreadsheets, I believe bc one set of tax is Net of Returns and the other is Gross of Returns. For further clarity on the discrepancy, please note the following, which is also outlined on the """"Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" tab: Even though the date range used is the exact same, there is a discrepancy in total tax owed (Ex Nevada $12K vs. $18K) in the individual state spreadsheet data of ""Orders"" (column E or see hardcopy) vs. the (Column D or hardcopy) ""Shopify Sales by Month 2019 by Shipping Region sales_2019-01-01_2019-12-31 (1)"" file, we believe because Column E ""Orders"" is GROSS of returns but the other Column D is Net of returns. Nisolo has had around a 25-30% Return rate historically. Again, the spreadsheet hosting only the individual state's info (column E or in hardcopy) is GROSS of returns, and returns have not been taken out, and therefore tax is higher. Again, the ""Shopify Sales by Month"" spreadsheet (Column D or hardcopy) is Net sales with tax NET of returns, and therefore is the more accurate reading of tax owed that needs to be paid. Chris, once you have a chance to review this material, please let me know if you have any questions or if this gives you all that you need for Zamp to ensure the past collected tax gets filed on time for March transactions so that we can pay it and close the states on time. Thank you!

The California tax-due estimate likely aligns with the tax amount due after accounting for the January and February 2025 prepayments; the remainder should be tied into March 2025 tax collection. We'll confirm this, though! For Washington, that tax-due estimate is higher because WA also has a Business & Occupation tax due when filing sales tax returns. This gross receipts tax is not collected from customers and is calculated at a rate of 0.471%. The B&O tax amount estimate is $38.80.

On the Shopify transactions, can you please clarify how that works with Shopify now remitting some of the taxes for us? It looks like they may not be remitting all of it? Sure! To our understanding, Shopify is now remitting any taxes collected through the 'SHOP' channel, which is tied into a specific payment method and marketplace via the Shop app (I believe this is an Android and iPhone app). They won't remit taxes collected from an order placed on BetterWild's website. This means that shop payments or channel orders can still come through with tax that BetterWild would need to remit via Zamp's filings. A way to see this could be using this Shopify report and adding a filter for 'Filed' under 'Filed by channel' like this: How are you handling those transactions? Our Engineering Team has already implemented measures to account for Marketplace sales through Shopify Shop. You will not be remitting taxes that Shopify has already remitted. Our Shopify integration can detect this when your store's transactions sync with Zamp. Zamp will then file the sales tax returns associated with the other transactions. I hope this helps!",Hi Rachel thank send file great question Shopify transaction clarify work Shopify remit taxis look like remit sure understanding Shopify remit taxis collect SHOP channel tie specific payment method marketplace Shop app believe Android iPhone app will remit taxis collect order place BetterWild website mean shop payment channel order come tax BetterWild need remit Zamp filing way Shopify report add filter file file channel like handle transaction Engineering Team implement measure account Marketplace sale Shopify Shop remit taxis Shopify remit Shopify integration detect store transaction sync Zamp Zamp file sale tax return associate transaction hope help

Can we deduct those extra numbers for May? Yes, once we've confirmed the exact difference and its various causes, we can discuss several different approaches to adjusting for it. We're currently evaluating a few potential causes of the difference, which are: Time zones are likely the biggest culprit, and we share more information here . When expanding the Shopify US Taxes Report date range, the tax amounts are higher than what Zamp estimated was due. I'm working on a transaction-by-transaction comparison between Shopify and Zamp to find the transactions that fall into this category and their tax amount. Refund transactions causing a state's local jurisdiction's tax balance to be less than $0 (or a negative amount).

Regarding the partial refunds and manually edited orders: Starting this month (or soon), for the filings that will be processed in June, we discussed using a CSV template (imported into Google Sheets) that follows Zamp's import template (attached). We will share how to prepare that file in this article . For the April 2025 transactions, I'll run our ""forced"" Shopify reconciliation script. Regarding editing orders within Loop instead of Shopify: This change would likely involve multiple pieces, and I hope the information below is helpful. Here are some Loop resources that I found about this, and it may be worth triple-checking for best practices from the Loop Support Team: Create a Return for a Customer Return Policy Settings Variant Exchange Different Priced Exchanges Advanced Exchanges Regarding outstanding state-specific items: I've also contacted Amelia about the outstanding items for any remaining states. While researching it a bit, I found that Amelia shared these outstanding items on 4/8/25 at 9:53 AM EST and followed up on 4/28/25 at 12:41 PM EST; the subject of that email was ' Re: Onboarding Call Follow up with Zamp '. I'm sharing this if it helps find the email, but Amelia will follow up as soon as possible. Here's what Amelia shared. I recommend directing any registration/account/state questions about this to Amelia or onboarding@zamp.com (if you have questions before Amelia reaches out). Great! Here is the list of states, contact details, and what we need to be able to file. Missouri - We still need to get the responsible party date of birth and ssn/itin of the person used at the time of registering in Missouri. 573-751-5860 North Carolina- Since there is no apparent registration id number outside of the SST number, you will need to call the state so they can advise steps needed - is the account is still open, next steps based on your current status, etc. You can ask them what is required by you to start filing online via non-SST or if a new registration is needed. NC contact number- 877-252-3052 Nevada- Since the login provided is not the master account login, you will need to call the state and they can advise/update the access to ensure your login is set as an administrator. Nevada contact number - 866-962-3707 Please let me know if you need any clarifications or have any questions on this. Please let me know if you or your team have any questions about the Loop Discount or the other items we discussed.

They manually edit orders if a customer calls or emails in, but they don't do that in Loop; it's within Shopify. They sometimes issue partial refunds for issues, discounts, promos, leaving reviews, etc., which ties into Shopify's limitations around partial refunds, which do not account for tax. They already track order edits and partial refunds internally, and can ask the team to enter that into a CSV or in a way that it can be put into a CSV (A Google Sheet most likely.)

Regarding the variance between Shopify and Zamp: We're still reviewing some Shopify reports, such as the Q1 2025 Texas Transactions Report , to determine why this difference exists. Part of what we've discovered happened here is that when we used the manual workaround method to import your Shopify data, the two transactions below were missed. CE1005X CE1004X We're still working through comparing the tax amounts between transactions in Zamp and transactions in Shopify to find the remaining difference. This is a piece that should be confirmed by tomorrow. This situation is something that we will help correct and ensure doesn't happen again in the future. If you have some time sometime soon, we'd be happy to hop on a call to talk about this and the path to resolving it. Regarding the Eventbrite transactions: This part of the import process was missed, and we've already taken steps to ensure it doesn't happen again, including adding additional reminders on our end. The good news here is that Eventbrite, as a marketplace , remits the taxes it collects to the state of Texas and other states listed in their article here . This means that while we do still want to import these transactions and report the gross sales to TX , your business doesn't need to remit the tax (Zamp includes this as a 'Marketplace Facilitator deduction' on filings.) When we create these kinds of transactions in Zamp, we do so with $0 tax collected to ensure Dandy Lion doesn't pay the tax twice. Regarding the Amazon transactions: I've found that Amazon transactions did not sync over to Zamp, but I've been unable to find any errors associated with this issue. I'm checking in with Amelia about a couple of items here in the morning. We can take an approach of having our team manually download these transactions each month to ensure they are accounted for as Marketplace Facilitator transactions, similar to Eventbrite. For Amazon and Eventbrite transactions, we can include them in a future filing, such as the Q2 2025 tax filing. We're also happy to discuss this on a call if you'd prefer. We're here to help resolve this and ensure Dandy Lion is compliant; fix these data situations.",Hi Jessica welcome variance Shopify Zamp review Shopify report Q1 2025 Texas Transactions Report determine difference exist discover happen manual workaround method import Shopify datum transaction miss CE1005X CE1004X work compare tax amount transaction Zamp transaction Shopify find remain difference piece confirm tomorrow situation help correct ensure happen future time soon happy hop talk path resolve eventbrite transaction import process miss take step ensure happen include add additional reminder end good news Eventbrite marketplace remit taxis collect state Texas state list article mean want import transaction report gross sale TX business need remit tax Zamp include Marketplace Facilitator deduction filing create kind transaction Zamp $ 0 tax collect ensure Dandy Lion pay tax twice Amazon transaction find Amazon transaction sync Zamp unable find error associate issue check Amelia couple item morning approach have team manually download transaction month ensure account Marketplace Facilitator transaction similar Eventbrite Amazon Eventbrite transaction include future filing q2 2025 tax filing happy discuss prefer help resolve ensure Dandy Lion compliant fix data situation

We understand where you're coming from with this and will be sure to improve. We're also happy to hop on a call to discuss this, after we've confirmed what happened. The reason this was a one-time exception and the cause of the difference is related to the email Amelia sent out a bit ago regarding your Shopify store's Shopify subscription and recent limitations implemented by Shopify. The Shopify changes caused Zamp to be unable to import all of your Shopify transactions, so we imported them manually using a workaround. I'm re-investigating the differences between the Shopify report and Zamp; I am also investigating what happened with the Eventbrite sales and Amazon sales. Please note that Amazon and Eventbrite both collect and remit (file) sales taxes in Texas and many other states as a Marketplace Facilitator. Meaning—those taxes are already paid to the state, and Dandy Lion LLC won't need to pay those taxes to the state, but each state (including TX) has reporting requirements for sellers.

I'd like assistance in formulating a response to the customer regarding the discrepancy they've observed between their filing and the Shopify report. The difference is less than 1%, and this can largely be attributed to rounding and time zones. I’ve also identified that the customer uses the Order Editing app, which will necessitate further investigation on our part. To ensure appropriate handling of this matter, I intend to focus my initial response on the rounding/timezone issue, deferring discussion regarding the third-party app until an alignment with Chris.

We're still investigating these differences, and I will rerun some reports from Shopify on Monday to see if anything changed and compare some pieces of the puzzle at the transaction level. So far, the main difference is related to California. A few questions: 1) Does the DT Ecom team use any third-party Shopify apps that allow orders to be edited after they are placed and before fulfillment? 2) If third-party apps aren't used for order editing, does that ever occur manually by your team? 3) Do you know if any of the third-party apps within your Shopify store create orders/transactions within Shopify for returns or exchanges? Does the Redo returns app allow this? We've seen this kind of behavior within Shopify when AfterShip or Loop are used; Redo is one app we haven't run into yet.

A colleague and I investigated this situation and found the following details; please let us know if you have any questions. Regarding the more minor differences: Zamp's tax-due estimate aligns closely with Shopify's US Sales Tax report when adjusting for time zones, timely filing discounts, state-specific rounding, etc; these variances are usually below 5%. The amounts in this Shopify US Sales Tax Report differ from the original list for various states. If you used this Report previously, it's possible it wasn't yet up-to-date, as I'm unsure how often these reports update in Shopify. In general, the differences noted here are mainly due to Zamp's adjustments to file based on each state's specific time zone, while Shopify uses a single time zone. In our article here , we discuss more of the differences noted above and other common differences between Zamp and Shopify. When I filter the Shopify US Sales Tax Report for the states filed monthly and then separately for the states filed quarterly while expanding the date range and summing the tax totals, it is within $78 of Zamp's estimate. Regarding Texas: The above includes Texas because the Shopify US Sales Tax report for TX and an example of the time zone differences here is the order noted below. When adjusting for the CST time zone, Order ID OB48264 in Zamp is reported as 3/1/25, but in Shopify, it's listed with a date of 2/28/25. The Shopify US Sales Tax report shows $1,075.59 in tax collected, which is $63.84 less than Zamp's total, which was recently updated to 1,139.43 (or 5.94%). We couldn't find any missing or extra transactions, and the tax amounts aligned with Shopify. I've also attached an export of the transactions Zamp is using to determine the tax due. I hope this is helpful to you. Please let us know if you have any questions. We'll need to move the filings along into the process by the end of the day tomorrow, April 15th, 2025 , to file by the state's due dates and avoid any penalties and interest.

Regarding California: Yes—this is happening because Zamp's understanding per One Bed's CA sales tax registration is that the filing frequency is what we call 'Quarterly Prepay,' which aligns with CA's pay monthly and file quarterly filing frequency. This does equal the monthly sales tax due in most scenarios, and we hope to improve our tax-due estimates in the future. We'll triple-check this and share that confirmation in our follow-up. Regarding the large difference you noted for Texas: This is interesting to hear. I have a few questions to help us understand why there is such a difference and the potential causes. 1) Does One Bed use third-party apps for returns/exchanges, such as Loop? 2) Does One Bed use third-party apps to allow customers to edit their orders after placing them? Is that done manually by the One Bed Team or at all? 3) Could you please confirm by sharing a screenshot or an export of the Shopify Report that you're reviewing and comparing against Zamp? 4) When you have a moment, could you please share One Bed's Collaborator request code with us?

Regarding California: This Fortunate One difference is similar to Hello Molly. This difference happens because Fortunate One makes monthly prepayments to CA and a quarterly filing (a quarterly prepay filing frequency). Here's a breakdown of this for Fortunate One: The January 2025 prepayment was $2,964.38 . The February 2025 prepayment was $4,161.28 . Total prepayments: $7,125.66 . Remaining tax-due estimate: $7,030.88 Combined total: $14,156.54 . Regarding the remaining states brought up here: The following states have different filing frequencies that are either annual or a non-standard quarter: Indiana has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. Nebraska has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. New York has a quarterly filing frequency, but this is within the fiscal quarter date range , so the next return is the NY Q1 2025 return, due in June 2025. Texas: To our understanding, Fortunate One is not currently registered for a sales tax permit or account in Texas. It's possible that the tax was accidentally collected within Shopify if someone accidentally turned it on previously. Still, it does not appear to be enabled currently, as we do not see any tax collection in TX. We'd recommend refunding the tax to the customer if tax were accidentally collected. This can happen when tax is collected on an order, and the address is later changed. If you know the Order ID associated with that order, we can investigate it further within Zamp. We've seen this happen with other companies we work with ( this Shopify community thread has some details), but we do not currently know a solution. We'd recommend that you check with Shopify support about the options here. A follow-up question: Considering the details noted above, do you know if we have your approval to proceed with Fortunate One's filings this month? Once you're ready for us to file, you can also click the blue ' Review & approve filings ' button. Otherwise and if we don't hear back about this, we'll resume filing by Thursday, April 10th, 2025 , to ensure timely filings. I hope this helps.

For the states where we have sales tax, can you please confirm that those states tax sales of food products? Of course! So that you know, the taxability of food will vary from state to state and from one product category (type/tax code) to another. To our understanding, the 'Nutrition Bars' category would be taxed in all those states except for those noted below. Washington D.C. —This is a small amount, and it could be leftover from the various product category changes you have been working on. Vermont —This is a small amount that could be related to the items noted for DC (above). Washington —The tax estimate here is mainly due to WA's Business & Occupation tax , a gross receipts tax not collected from customers but due when filing a sales tax return; the remainder could be similar to the two states noted above. The WA B&O tax amount is $461.35. I hope this helps.

So there's no way to retroactively find the date of the transaction being finalized. So what I'm doing is running the gamefound report on the last day of the month.

Which means I'll have to reverse out all the March activity from the April report based on what I recognize in March before I send it to you. It's a pretty big hassle, but BackerKit worked the same way!

We will get the WV invoice 11490 voided, as that will be faster on our end (instead of waiting for a delete request), and that should allow me to send you the updated amounts tonight.

I hope you're doing well! Thanks for your patience.

To answer your questions: 1) We do have a small batch of US customers who actually do request to be billed in CAD. Oftentimes it has to do with three reasons: (1) they have a Canadian CPA employee, or (2) they hold some CAD for FX hedging. Unfortunately, those ones won't have a USD amount inherently - the two possible solutions here would just be to: Accept that the foreign amount is in CAD but just say it's in USD for nexus analysis - it's such a small batch of customers with small amounts that if that's the reason we hit nexus we were going to hit nexus next month Find an average FX rate to convert them at in order to get to the final amount 2) The foreign amount in Quickbooks is the amount in the invoice currency (so typically a US customer's foreign amount will be in USD). Now here's the issue - the tax amount and the net amount are ALWAYS in CAD in Quickbooks and we haven't identified a field that shows those amounts in the invoice currency.

Let me know if you wanna hop on a call to find a workaround or discuss any of this as tomorrow we can definitely make some time!

Cheers,

Bill",hi Chris hope thank patience answer question 1 small batch customer actually request bill CAD oftentime reason 1 canadian cpa employee 2 hold cad FX hedging unfortunately one will usd inherently possible solution accept foreign cad usd nexus analysis small batch customer small amount reason hit nexus go hit nexus month find average FX rate convert order final 2 foreign Quickbooks invoice currency typically customer foreign USD issue tax net cad Quickbooks identify field show amount invoice currency let know wanna hop find workaround discuss tomorrow definitely time bill

Yes, I'm positive it's related to negative amounts in specific jurisdictions because the negative amounts line up with the differences. This scenario can happen anytime the two conditions below are met, and my understanding is that Zamp has behaved this way the whole time (with slight adjustments over the last year, possibly.) In these cases, an item is purchased in one month (January) and returned the following month (February, still within a 14-day or 30-day window). There aren't any other sales to that specific jurisdiction in the following month to fully cover the refund, or there are no sales to that particular jurisdiction. On our side, the transaction export is used to build the filing team's summary totals, but that summary is different; it's a state-specific sales tax internal report used to file the returns. I'm pulling data from the same source. This could also be occurring more often because we're adjusting for edited orders, voided transactions, and items that cause refunds across multiple jurisdictions. These are the Order IDs causing the negative amounts in local jurisdictions: #23832930 #23828180 #23837460 #23830180 #23834760 #23832720 #23836330 #23833050 #23822770 #23821470 #23830810 REF-6115898589436 #23835120 #23832520 #23837570 I hope this helps!",hi Jason thank input understand yes positive relate negative amount specific jurisdiction negative amount line difference scenario happen anytime condition meet understanding Zamp behave way time slight adjustment year possibly case item purchase month January return follow month February 14 day 30 day window sale specific jurisdiction following month fully cover refund sale particular jurisdiction transaction export build filing team summary total summary different state specific sale tax internal report file return pull datum source occur adjust edit order void transaction item cause refund multiple jurisdiction order id cause negative amount local jurisdiction 23832930 23828180 23837460 23830180 23834760 23832720 23836330 23833050 23822770 23821470 23830810 REF-6 23835120 23832520 23837570 hope help

I thought it would be just from January because of the higher amount of returns from December orders, combined with a seasonal drop off into January. We're definitely sure it's related to the negative amounts for specific jurisdictions right? Because I don't recall this happening at all last year, but now we've had 2 months with this issue. It seems either our transaction list export is missing something, or the filing team's calculation is being done differently this year. Form what I remember last year, the excel transaction list was usually more of an 'export' of the filing team's summary -- and so the numbers would generally match since it was from the same 'source'. Now it seems our transaction export and the filing team's summary totals are from a slightly different 'source', but with the 2 sources.

After completing the investigation, I've found that all variances where the estimated tax due variance amount is above 5% are related to refunds causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions within a state. This is the primary cause for CA, CO, GA, and TN. This means that some refunds in the export I shared with you could not be accounted for because, according to the various states' rules (as noted during previous discussions/calls), we cannot file negative amounts in any state jurisdiction. For Texas, due to the low percent difference (~2.13%) and ruling out refunds in local jurisdictions as the cause, that difference is very likely related to rounding at the line item level (per transaction) when summing values for local jurisdictions. It's also possible that I'm unaware of other state-specific logic in place. I hope this is helpful.

I'm re-running some background processes and giving them extra time to complete in case there's something ""stuck""/processing on the tax engine or database side.

Our filing team is aware of the situation and noted that, as an exception, we'll still be able to file on Monday on time.

We found a way to temporarily adjust to account for the order edit situation and other factors that could lead to your noted differences. We're still fine-tuning this method, but we have surfaced it for our engineering team to explore as a solution to force reconciliation between Zamp and Shopify. I've attached a file showing the tax amounts from Shopify and Zamp; this was used to determine the adjustments needed. We adjusted for the amounts by the difference noted in column F. The variance is slight enough to be related to time zones, rounding, and other state-specific causes; we share more details here . One essential point is that we discovered Shopify's US Sales Tax report does not include tax on shipping (' total_shipping_tax_amount ') in the ' total_item_tax_amount ' column. Shopify's reporting separately buckets shipping and item taxes; this article shares more details . This also means that the variance is a lower tax amount. As we discussed, we still plan to evaluate previous filing periods (including January 2025) and determine the best path forward for making those adjustments. This will start tomorrow and continue into next week. Please let us know if you have any questions!",hi MJ follow tax estimate find way temporarily adjust account order edit situation factor lead noted difference fine tune method surface engineering team explore solution force reconciliation Zamp Shopify attach file show tax amount Shopify Zamp determine adjustment need adjust amount difference note column F. variance slight relate time zone round state specific cause share detail essential point discover Shopify Sales Tax report include tax shipping total_shipping_tax_amount total_item_tax_amount column Shopify reporting separately bucket shipping item taxis article share detail mean variance low tax discuss plan evaluate previous filing period include January 2025 determine good path forward make adjustment start tomorrow continue week let know question

This could be related to our recent database migration and backed-up processing queues, so I escalated this to our engineering team.

Just remember that the token provided by Becky is for a sandbox account and development purposes, but since the Adobe Commerce site is still under active development, it should be safe to use on their primary site until the live one becomes available.

[OneTimeSecret Link] - please note this will only allow you to view one time Here's the link to get into the test Zamp dashboard using this email - mjhaveri@squariongroup.com. You will need to create a password to set up your account. API Resources -- We have a wealth of documentation available at https://developer.zamp.com/ . If you or your team have any questions related to the API or any of the information in the documentation, guides, or sales tax questions, please feel free to reach us at support@zamp.com . Calculating States -- Zamp's API works by having logic that is directly associated with the account configurations that it's tied to. For example, you wouldn't receive calculations in states we don't have your company registered in -- you'd get back ""taxDue"": 0.0 every time. To curve this to suit your early API adoption needs, we set up the following states for you. Also note that you should test all calls to the calculations endpoint with a date on or after 01/01/2024. This date represents the test accounts' ""Nexus Start Date"" for each state -- states you would want to calculate how much sales tax to collect for. On our initial onboarding call, we will configure your production account with all states you will need to calculate sales tax for, along with the associated ""imposition"" types. Imposition types determine the logic our API will use to apply the correct rate. The list of states below are ones that you should be receiving sales tax ""taxDue"" in, where the value is other than 0.

We investigated this further and found that the difference is related to the three reasons, noted below. The reasons are: 17 SplitOrder transactions from September 2024 through December 2024 were not previously adjusted for and were brought into the February 2025 filing period to assist in recovering the tax for those transactions. This was for a total of -$59.11 . 19 SplitOrder transactions occurred on 2/1/2025 which were included in the January 2025 filing in February because Zamp adjusts for the state-specific timezone in our filings. These adjustments were brought into the February 2025 filing period to ensure the SplitOrders were accounted for. This was a total of -$57.28 . Depending on the state, the remaining difference is likely related to timezone adjustments of 2/28/2025 through 3/1/2025. This typically accounts for 1-2% of a variance between Zamp and Shopify with tax collected. This would account for the remaining $21.33 difference. I hope this helps.

Stripe sends webhook events to your server to notify you of activity in your Stripe account, such as a completed payout or a newly-created invoice. The URL of the failing webhook endpoint is: https://c69b-2401-4900-881c-a542-6dd8-4846-f7e6-9fc3.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/stripe/ You (or someone on your team) configured your Stripe account to send events to that URL. You can change your account's webhook endpoints from the Dashboard . In most cases, a failing webhook does not impact your payments or payouts. However: If you use subscriptions we rely on your webhook endpoint to notify you of new invoices. These invoices may be delayed for up to three days if your endpoint is unable to successfully receive them. If you use Checkout and rely on the checkout.session.completed event as part of your purchase fulfillment process , you should review your completed payments to ensure you have fulfilled all recent purchases. We've attempted to send event notifications to this endpoint 9 times since the first failure on March 9, 2025 at 11:58:10 AM UTC. If this endpoint is important to your application, please try and fix the issue. If you do not need this webhook endpoint, you can remove it from your Stripe webhook settings . We will stop sending event notifications to this webhook endpoint by March 18, 2025 at 11:58:10 AM UTC. Here is the summary of errors we received while attempting to send webhook events: 9 requests returned HTTP 404, indicating the URL doesn't exist. You should verify the endpoint URL is correct in your Stripe webhook settings. You need to return any status code between HTTP 200 to 299 for Stripe to consider the webhook event successfully delivered. For more details on these errors and to review your account's recent activity, you can find the full set of events and request logs on the Dashboard. For more in-depth information on how to use webhooks, we recommend reviewing our documentation . Yours, The Stripe team This email relates to your Auto Advocate Inc. Stripe account.

Yes, this looks like what we need. Could you please confirm if the points below are correct to ensure we understand the data correctly? The 'Talbots' invoices should be imported into Zamp as wholesale transactions with Greencastle, IN 46135 as the Ship To address. These invoices are: 10983 10984 10985 10986 10987 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. 10988 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. 10989 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. One of the ' Talbots ' invoices (10990) would be attributed to Pataskala, OH. We'll import the ' Wholesale - US ' customer group invoices (Urban Outfitters) as wholesale with the provided delivery details. The ' Wholesale Australia ' invoices would not be imported as they're delivered to locations within Australia, or other countries. The exception appears to be this invoice delivered to Florida: 10917 Based on the data we've imported into Zamp in the past, the above is likely the route to take here (outside of the 'Wholesale Australia' invoice to FL) but we wanted to confirm just in case. I was curious because I have not seen any sales tax payments being made. Just wanted to double check that's correct? As far as we know, this should be correct. Within Zamp, we can see that Standard Procedure is registered to file quarterly in California. Zamp has filed the Q2, Q3, and Q4 2024 CA returns; with Q4 2024 filed in January 2025.

Is it ok to report the last month's transactions to Zamp so that any refunds can be reported successfully? What is the recommended way to handle this? Yes, this is 100% OK! Zamp generally recommends importing sales data back to January 1 of the previous year (in this case, 1/1/2024) for nexus analysis. If refunds are involved, it's best to do this via the API instead of a CSV to ensure the relationship can be made between refunds that can occur in the future (depending on when orders sync to Zamp.) We'd recommend backfilling (syncing) transactions from last month directly with our /transactions API endpoint. Still, we recommend keeping the request volume to 2-3 requests per minute to avoid any rate limits. There are plans to increase or scale this in the future, but those are further down the line after additional database improvements, various internal decisions, and roadmap priorities. Typically an async/await pattern with a delay will work here. Here's a basic JavaScript example I've shared to handle this kind of sync while ensuring to be under the rate limit: await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); This could be done using an existing integration if your integration supports it, or we'd recommend building a separate but related feature to handle this kind of logic (a manual sync/backfill feature can be helpful if needed).

I've confirmed that the NY tax-due estimate has changed to 15,687.64 and stayed at that amount; this is close to the amount you noted. Slight variances can occur here due to state-specific tax logic (e.g., rounding, time zones, etc.). We will be able to ensure timely filing as long as we can move the filings along by this Friday (3/14/25). Regarding CO: I've looked into this further and have been unable to find missing or different transactions. The Shopify US Taxes Report (which won't always align with Zamp) shows an amount of $925.25 and the Shopify Orders View here also shows similar orders/details. There's one extra order, 6959730622526/HOS4524407918 which is tied to a gift card and is treated as non-taxable within Zamp. The Zamp CO tax-due estimate also includes a timely filing discount, which is called a 'Service Fee' in CO; that amount is 16.27. I've attached an export of these transactions to help simplify our investigation here. Do you see any differences? Would you have any thoughts to share about the above?","hi Heather thank patient confirm NY tax estimate change 15,687.64 stay close note slight variance occur state specific tax logic e.g. rounding time zone etc able ensure timely filing long filing Friday 3/14/25 CO look unable find missing different transaction Shopify Taxes Report will align Zamp show $ 925.25 Shopify Orders View show similar order detail extra order 6 HOS tie gift card treat non taxable Zamp Zamp CO tax estimate include timely filing discount call Service Fee CO 16.27 attach export transaction help simplify investigation difference thought share"

We've completed our review and the work to adjust for the differences that you've noted. Most of the transactions were voids/cancellations, and our engineering team is working to improve that (we're happy to help adjust for this). One item listed in the sheet was R-971545706558 and I left this transaction as it is because it was a refund for a January 2025 order ( HOS4524365218 ) which ended up in the February 2025 period due to the date it was refunded. This one fully refunded the tax associated with the original transaction. Please note that Order ID 6949117952062 (Shopify Order: HOS4524395718 ) was an edited order. While we understand that editing orders typically provides the best customer experience, our integration is unable to support these because Shopify's APIs do not expose all of the necessary details surrounding order edits to our integration. This means that we highly recommend against editing orders and instead creating a full refund and a separate order. We can adjust for these occasionally to help, but we won't be able to do it regularly if the volume of those kinds of edits grows. I've attached a file that was used to adjust for these differences, and we'll soon send out a tax-due estimate. Please let me know if you have any questions.

A couple of quick questions: For Zamp or any sales tax compliance solution, we need an address associated with an invoice to report the invoice properly within state jurisdictions. 1) Should we use the billing address for the invoices without a shipping address, or would your team need to update the shipping addresses? I'm asking because many invoices, including those with sales tax collected, do not have a shipping address. Sales tax calculations and filings are based on the shipping address for physical products. 2) Also, is it correct that your invoices without sales tax would be considered wholesale/resale or tax-exempt for another reason? These questions will help us understand your data and ensure we file your January 2025 sales tax return accurately.

If you're able to copy data from our sheets into templates we could happily provide our ongoing tours each month. Would that be easiest? My only concerns here are that until we scale and staff properly, we may make mistakes. The best way is to can ensure we do this properly would be to send links to all our ongoing tours monthly. Is that manageable? Each shoed would look like the attached screen shot below.

Some months we have several tours and some months there will be none! As it stands there's only 3 tours on our schedule for the year and 1 is about to wrap up on Saturday (the one in the screen shot below)

I will review the various email threads (and notes) regarding past situations, and then I can share some recommendations. One way could be to have a separate sheet (or file) containing the tour merch revenues completed for the month by the 1st to 3rd of each month. This approach should be OK, but one sure way to avoid any differences would be to use our CSV template and provide us with the data each month (after any currency conversions and validation on your end). We could also share the data with you after processing and before importing into Zamp (if preferable.) One item we'll do on our end, is ensure we only copy/export/record data for the current month using the 'Date' column and the data highlighted in the screenshot below:",hi Crispin interesting hear review email thread note past situation share recommendation way separate sheet file contain tour merch revenue complete month 1st 3rd month approach ok sure way avoid difference use csv template provide datum month currency conversion validation end share datum process import Zamp preferable item end ensure copy export record datum current month date column datum highlight screenshot

There have been instances of errors being made when calculating tax owed in the past for our touring revenues so if there's any methodology we can use to create checks and balances and verify the amounts being remitted that would be ideal.

I'll have more detail to share tomorrow and can likely share a broader data set this week. The heart of the situation here will be that Zamp uses multiple time zones in our filings because our team found that adjusting for the state's time zone was the most technically compliant approach regarding sales tax filings across all states. This means that Zamp would use a PST time zone for CA, an MST time zone for CO, a CST time zone for IL, an EST time zone for OH, etc. Shopify uses a single time zone for its store, which is usually the primary location for the store. We share more information about this in our article here . Zamp extracts data from the 'baby bub' Shopify store when an order is placed. We do this via Shopify's Admin Orders API (and possibly a few other API endpoints). We receive the data in UTC and have some checks around dates/time zones. Then, Zamp adjusts for the state's specific time zone and various state-specific sales tax requirements. This means lining up data 1:1 between Zamp (and many sales tax compliance solutions) will be tricky. However, this will be simpler if we focus on a single state, California. We're happy to help explain the various pieces and share the data. We appreciate your patience and understanding! A couple of quick questions: What time zone is your Shopify store based in? This will help me understand the potential differences. Also, when you have a moment, could you please share your Shopify store's collaborator access code ? It appears Zamp's access auto-expired as that can happen every 90-days.",Hi Siddharth thank follow great question detail share tomorrow likely share broad datum set week heart situation Zamp use multiple time zone filing team find adjust state time zone technically compliant approach sale tax filing state mean Zamp use PST time zone MST time zone CO CST time zone IL est time zone OH etc Shopify use single time zone store usually primary location store share information article zamp extract datum baby bub Shopify store order place Shopify Admin Orders API possibly API endpoint receive datum utc check date time zone Zamp adjust state specific time zone state specific sale tax requirement mean line datum 1:1 Zamp sale tax compliance solution tricky simple focus single state California happy help explain piece share datum appreciate patience understanding couple quick question time zone Shopify store base help understand potential difference moment share Shopify store collaborator access code appear Zamp access auto expire happen 90 day

I've attached an export of your California November 2024 transactions, which were used to calculate the California prepayment amount for that same month. A few items to note about this file: The tax used in our calculations is listed in column J ( transactionTax .) This is an export that I modified as a one-time exception to be what we call ""transaction-level,"" which means that it does not have the usual line items shown in our exports. This was done to simplify summing the tax and other amounts, but we can share a line item file if you'd like. (Note: line item files have order IDs and transaction-level (tax, subtotal, discounts, etc.) repeated; summing them in Excel can be tricky.) The Transaction IDs shown in the file are in column B ( transactionId ), and we have access to this ID via Shopify's API. Within Shopify, this ID is available in an order's URL, and you can still search for orders via these IDs in Shopify Admin. In a Shopify order export, this ID is included in column BD (titled Id .) The date listed in column L ( transactionDate ) is a UTC date and our filings convert these dates into the state's specific time zone; we share more details in this article .

After reviewing the stores involved again, the Shopify sales data syncs on our end, and we have confirmed with our engineering team the causes of the missing Shopify data. Those causes are: The transactions were missing for the Chuckle Sandwich store because the initial bulk sync for historical data from Shopify only included 1/1/2024-1/28/2024; it was a typo when initiating the sync; we'll catch these better in the future. For the Flashgitz, the missing transaction (#FLG8425) failed to sync to Zamp because of an invalid address. During our transaction sync process with any Shopify store, we attempt to confirm that the address exists. If it does not, we cannot import the transaction (this happens very rarely). The above also means that this is not a systemic issue and should be a one-time situation. Lastly, I've also audited all of the historical imports for the stores noted below (these have been connected since 12/1/2024) to ensure this kind of date-related typo scenario hasn't happened with other stores, and we're all set, in the clear, with these.

After investigating this further, the amounts shown for the payments to the various state DORs are correct and match the sales data within Zamp for Oats Overnight. This applies to each state noted in the screenshot: AR, SD, RI, GA, and TN. The reasons for these differences vary: For Georgia, the difference was a $4.32 vendor's compensation credit/discount from the state of GA for timely filing. RI matched the initial notice. The difference was primarily caused by Shopify Transactions imported after the tax-due estimate was sent for AR, SD, and TN. These transactions occurred within January 2025 but were imported on 2/4/25 or after. I hope this helps.

I've attached some files to show the data we exported from QBO to accomplish this and the file we imported into Zamp.

The second file, "" TechTradeSolutions - QBO Export - 01JAN2025-31JAN2025.csv ,"" is the file we're importing into Zamp to rebuild the tax-due estimate. After reviewing the data, all missing invoices were present except for the TX invoice ( 30099 ) because, within QBO, it's dated 2/5/2025. This means we'll import that invoice next month for the February 2025 TX filing due then. As soon as we send you the tax-due estimate, we'll need to hear back from you about approval to proceed quickly today or tomorrow to ensure we can complete the various state sales tax returns by the due dates.

Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do other than escalate it to the builders to see if they have any ideas, but I doubt that will go anywhere, although it would be great to solve this. This is ultimately something they'd need to bring up with Shopify. One possible resolution is to cancel the original order before payment or process a full refund. Then, a new order with the corrected address could be placed. However, this isn't a good or efficient process, and they likely wouldn't like the customer experience involved. Others are aware of this, as far as I know.

I believe that I answered this through another email thread with Becky, and I've shared that answer below. Please let me know if you have any questions! I'm jumping in to help answer the outstanding API question. So that you know, any API (or technical) questions can also be directed to support@zamp.com ; those questions can also be routed to the team I'm a part of. 🙂 How would a refund transaction affect reporting for the following month? Would it just be netted against the transactions of that month? For example, if a Jan 26th transaction is refunded on Feb 6th, that negative amount on Feb 6th would be used to offset the transactions in Feb. Yes, if a refund transaction is created within Zamp on February 6th, 2025, it will be netted against the transactions for February 2025. The other option is not to create the transaction within Zamp. Instead, someone on the Wayo team would file an amended return with the state associated with the transaction to recover the refunded sales tax.",Hi Hanna thank check believe answer email thread Becky share answer let know question jump help answer outstanding api question know api technical question direct question route team 🙂 refund transaction affect report following month net transaction month example Jan 26th transaction refund Feb 6th negative Feb 6th offset transaction Feb. yes refund transaction create Zamp February 6th 2025 net transaction February 2025 option create transaction Zamp instead Wayo team file amend return state associate transaction recover refunded sale tax

We reviewed the differences you noted between Washington and Nevada and found they are expected. I'll share more details below. Overall, the cause of the difference relates to state-specific sales tax logic built into our tax-due estimates (and, by extension, our filings) that are not accounted for when looking at a raw tax collected amount within BigCommerce, Shopify, Volusion, or other systems. Regarding WA: You noted that $1,376.30 was collected in tax, and the tax-due estimate from Zamp was $1,492.27 . The difference here is $115.97 . While reviewing the filing details associated with the WA January 2025 return, we found that most of this difference is due to the WA B&O tax. This gross receipts tax is not collected from customers and is due when filing sales tax returns. This amount was $147.39 . Please note that state-specific rounding and time zone differences ( noted in this article , which mentions Shopify, but these scenarios can apply to other platforms/carts/systems as well) are likely responsible for the overall difference. Depending on the number of transactions and the state, these two items can cause variances of a few dollars up to hundreds of dollars. Regarding NV: You noted that $617.61 was collected in tax, and the tax-due estimate from Zamp was $660.10 . The difference here is $42.49 . We reviewed all of the Nevada transactions from multiple angles, looking for any potential missing transactions or situations that might cause differences; we could not find anything that raised concerns. The difference for NV is also likely related to rounding or a time zone difference between the transactions you're viewing in your reports and the time zone Zamp uses. In NV, Zamp's estimates and filings adjust for transactions that fall within the Pacific Time Zone (PST), which can cause transactions to occur at the beginning or end of a filing period (the first or last day). I've also attached an export containing all transactions synced with Zamp shipped to customers in Nevada; the amount is close to your initial amount. We also share some details about our filing notices and tax-due estimates that may be helpful in this article . Do we have your approval to proceed with the Dorm Company Corporation's filings for January 2025?","Hi Taylor follow quick update review difference note Washington Nevada find expect share detail overall cause difference relate state specific sale tax logic build tax estimate extension filing account look raw tax collect BigCommerce Shopify Volusion system WA note $ 1,376.30 collect tax tax estimate Zamp $ 1,492.27 difference $ 115.97 review filing detail associate WA January 2025 return find difference WA B&O tax gross receipt tax collect customer file sale tax return $ 147.39 note state specific rounding time zone difference note article mention Shopify scenario apply platform cart system likely responsible overall difference depend number transaction state item cause variance dollar hundred dollar NV note $ 617.61 collect tax tax estimate Zamp $ 660.10 difference $ 42.49 review Nevada transaction multiple angle look potential missing transaction situation cause difference find raise concern difference NV likely relate round time zone difference transaction view report time zone Zamp use NV Zamp estimate filing adjust transaction fall Pacific Time Zone PST cause transaction occur beginning end filing period day attach export contain transaction sync Zamp ship customer Nevada close initial share detail filing notice tax estimate helpful article approval proceed Dorm Company Corporation filing January 2025"

3253,2839446992,99080,8720452681,message,2025-03-12T22:50:17Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Kayley, Jackie, and Team, Thanks again for your patience! We looked into this from multiple angles and found that the primary cause of differences in the January 2025 filing processed in February was related to two items, which I'll note below. The first item concerns a limitation of Shopify's reporting, and the second concerns the Loop Discount being disabled within Loop, as AvaTax requires (which is the opposite of what Zamp needs). The Shopify Sales tax by Region Report does not appear to include POS or in-person store sales. This accounted for $47,110.05 of the difference. The Loop Exchange orders were duplicating tax on a small subset of orders, ~80 orders in January and another ~80 in February. This accounted for $3,737.42 of the difference. The above means that $3,737.42 in tax was overpaid out of the initial estimate of $50,001.50 . The good news is that we're adjusting for that this month for any monthly filings and in future filings for any non-monthly filings. Here's a breakdown based on the original figures shared from Zamp and by Jackie in February: Regarding the Shopify Sales tax by Region Report : When we exported transactions from Shopify, we found that there weren't orders missing within Zamp when comparing a Zamp export to the Shopify export. Here's what we did in this Report to sort this out: When we sorted the 'Is POS sale' column descending so that 'Yes' was at the top, we found that there were only two indications of this at the top for FL and CA. Here's what this looked like: We also found that the number of rows with 'Is POS sale' did not increase or change when we grouped by the Order ID: In the above screenshot, it appears to account for only two orders. The query powering the Shopify Report likely needs some additional tweaking or filtering. This report is a newer release from Shopify using their ShopifyQL option, and we're still learning more about it. This could be related to the lack of a billing or destination address for POS orders, or some specific quirk to how Shopify built/queries this report. We could help you determine the best way to deal with that report and improve the data it returns, but Shopify Plus Support can likely help more efficiently. Please let us know if you'd like to schedule a call with Ashley and me. Regarding Loop Exchange orders duplicating tax: As we discussed on our call, this is a situation in which Zamp needs the opposite of an AvaTax setting requirement. We will raise this issue as a feature request to our engineering team and ask them to explore accounting for it in future improvements. For now and in the future, we will adjust for this manually by creating 'refund offset' transactions to remove the duplicate tax, and we'll eventually have a way to exclude these transactions altogether. I've imported adjustment files to offset the duplicate tax from Loop Exchange orders into your Zamp account for both of the months below: January 2025 - recovering $3,737.42 in sales tax. February 2025 - ensuring $3,165.80 in sales tax is not duplicated. Once the adjustments are processed, we will send you a tax-due estimate either tonight or tomorrow (3/13). Please let me know if you have any questions. If it's better to talk through this, I'm happy to hop on a call .","hello Kayley Jackie Team thank patience look multiple angle find primary cause difference January 2025 filing process February relate item note item concern limitation Shopify reporting second concern Loop Discount disable Loop AvaTax require opposite Zamp need Shopify Sales tax Region Report appear include POS person store sale account $ 47,110.05 difference Loop Exchange order duplicate tax small subset order ~80 order January ~80 February account $ 3,737.42 difference mean $ 3,737.42 tax overpay initial estimate $ 50,001.50 good news adjust month monthly filing future filing non monthly filing breakdown base original figure share Zamp Jackie February Shopify Sales tax Region Report export transaction Shopify find order miss Zamp compare zamp export Shopify export report sort sort POS sale column descend yes find indication FL look like find number row POS sale increase change group Order ID screenshot appear account order query power Shopify Report likely need additional tweaking filtering report new release Shopify shopifyql option learn relate lack billing destination address POS order specific quirk Shopify build query report help determine good way deal report improve datum return Shopify plus Support likely help efficiently let know like schedule Ashley Loop Exchange order duplicate tax discuss situation zamp need opposite AvaTax set requirement raise issue feature request engineering team ask explore account future improvement future adjust manually create refund offset transaction remove duplicate tax eventually way exclude transaction altogether import adjustment file offset duplicate tax Loop Exchange order Zamp account month January 2025 recover $ 3,737.42 sale tax February 2025 ensure $ 3,165.80 sale tax duplicate adjustment process send tax estimate tonight tomorrow 3/13 let know question well talk happy hop"

Time zone differences, which includes refunds. ————————————————————————————————————————- Notes from the call with Jackie, Kayley (Shopify/Ecomm team), Tasia (analyst/ecomm team, and Carina (Cult Gaia CS) -45 minutes. Jackie said she's probably OK with adjustments and they want the refund for the extra tax paid. She wants to know the amount for the past overpayments and needs to share this with her CFO. They're not going to switch from or go off of AvaTax, they just upgraded and signed another contract (from the sound of it.) They'll let their CFO know. They use AvaTax with other countries as well. Shopify apps: They use NetSuite, which goes from Shopify to NetSuite via Celigo. Loop should be the only other one.

Do you happen to log your requests to our /calculations endpoint, or associate them with the transactions on your side? If so, do you have a .txt export by chance? It would be great to see the request bodies on calculations and compare to the transaction data. For an explanation on timezone handling, here are a few key highlights: We ingest transactions and save them via UTC. So for example, if you pass to us a transaction  that you've localized the 'transactionDate' for as '2025-04-01T06:00:00.000Z', we will treat that as 6:00am UTC, which is technically 2025-03-31 as a reported transaction date. We now allow viewing transactions by a specific timezone in our Transactions interface when logged into Zamp, so you could view it in PST if you chose to. We file and localize transactions based on the state's timezone . When it comes down to states that span multiple timezones, we get even more specific and go by the timezone of the state's capitol .

The issue: The customer was expecting to see a tax payment of $40,575 for the remaining tax due for the Q1 2025 CA period (after January and February prepayments). The report they shared above (starting with 'RPT_Mike...') shows 40,720.24. They're based in CA, so it's unlikely that the cause is a time zone difference, but it could be (if they run their report in UTC vs. Zamp filing in PST, or some other edge-case difference). This is also an API customer, so we'd expect what they collect to match Zamp's calculations. So, this is a bit different from a Zamp vs Shopify reconciliation. For Zamp API customers, we set transactionRecalculate to true by default when creating transactions in Zamp; we always file based on taxDue not taxCollected (which is the opposite of what we do for Shopify/other non-API integrations.) What I've found so far: We see very little under-collection in the CA report ($0.22): https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/state-reports/CA/2025-Q1 These are all of the Q1 2025 CA transactions, $133k: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/transactions?date=2025-01-01~2025-03-31&shipToState=CA We see $42,455.63 for March 2025: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/transactions?date=2025-03-01%7E2025-03-31&shipToState=CA This is still higher than the initial estimate. Looking at all their transactions for Q1 2025 in CA, I don't see any transactions that likely caused this difference overall (in Q1 or March 2025) because they were primarily created or updated within the same period. Query: https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/6436-transaction-export-by-a-state-list-with-reportedon-and-zampcreated?company=clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas&start=2025-01-01&end=2025-03-31 This export is attached. I don't see any concerns or significant variation between taxDue and taxCollected when exporting the variance review query here ; an export is attached. We may look at March 2025 for CA on its own, but I don't see causes for concern here. Overall, my theory is that there is a difference in reporting between their system and Zamp but I can't quite prove it yet.","@nick @ryan @lucas time help look issue customer expect tax payment $ 40,575 remain tax q1 2025 period January February prepayment report share start rpt_mike show 40,720.24 base unlikely cause time zone difference run report UTC vs. Zamp filing PST edge case difference api customer expect collect match Zamp calculation bit different Zamp vs Shopify reconciliation Zamp api customer set transactionrecalculate true default create transaction Zamp file base taxdue taxcollected opposite Shopify non api integration find far little collection report $ 0.22 q1 2025 transaction $ 133k $ 42,455.63 March 2025 high initial estimate look transaction q1 2025 transaction likely cause difference overall Q1 March 2025 primarily create update period query export attach concern significant variation taxdue taxcollected export variance review query export attach look March 2025 cause concern overall theory difference reporting system Zamp prove"

We're investigating these differences, and I've started looking into it.

When you have a moment, could you share the records or an export of the transaction data used to build the XLSX tax jurisdiction report you shared?

We looked into this further and found that the refund (#GILS1477) from the Gils Arena store was imported into Zamp; I've attached an export from Zamp showing this. This export can also be requested by logging into your Zamp portal and navigating to the Transactions page here with state and date range filters. Here's how to request an export: Just so you know, this screenshot was taken within a test account, and you will see something different within your Zamp account. Here's what I see within the Underdog Sports Holdings Zamp account: Here's what is happening with this refund: Within Zamp, a refund Transaction is not accounted for within the tax-due estimate if it will cause a local Jurisdiction to become negative (e.g., '-3.91' in this transaction's situation). The above means that this refund transaction (#GILS1477) caused the local jurisdiction of HAMPTON CITY to be negative, as there were $0 in sales to that jurisdiction. Most states do not allow sales tax returns to be filed with negative amounts. Please note that the Virginia Department of Taxation can issue a refund or credit. Their PDF documentation outlines how to submit such a request . Next steps: Do we have your approval to proceed with your sales tax filings for the January 2025 filing period this month? If Zamp is to file for Underdog Sports Holdings this month, we must hear back about this approval by Friday (2/14/25).",hi Tra thank continue patience look find refund gils1477 Gils Arena store import Zamp attach export Zamp show export request log Zamp portal navigate Transactions page state date range filter request export know screenshot take test account different Zamp account Underdog Sports Holdings Zamp account happen refund Zamp refund Transaction account tax estimate cause local Jurisdiction negative e.g. -3.91 transaction situation mean refund transaction GILS1477 cause local jurisdiction HAMPTON CITY negative $ 0 sale jurisdiction state allow sale tax return file negative amount note Virginia Department Taxation issue refund credit PDF documentation outline submit request step approval proceed sale tax filing January 2025 filing period month Zamp file Underdog Sports Holdings month hear approval Friday 2/14/25

I tried to do as much research on it as I could. The customer says that a refund is missing from their VA filing, but the refund does appear in our system and the report is zeroed out for associated jurisdiction. My guess is that they might be expecting the total $3.14 due in VA to be offset by refund #GILS1477 (-$3.91). The sales posted to VA this month are in other counties than where the refund is posted. I remember hearing that refunds are magic mathed to zero out, but I'm not familiar enough with how our system handles them.

Zamp's tax-due estimate amounts for Texas, Illinois, Alabama, and Indiana are now in line with your expectations. The differences here appear to be related to state-specific sales tax rounding, time zone differences between how Zamp files returns and QBO reports tax amounts, and state-specific timely filing discounts (which are included in most of our estimates.)

They essentially use cash accounting, partly because sometimes payments fail for subscriptions in Stripe, and their CS team has a process to retry, reach out, etc, eventually it becomes 'uncollectible.' After explaining the human error when investigating the CSV/Zamp Stripe integration differences, River noted a large gross sales/revenue difference but a minimal tax difference.

The results below are from using the total column sum by clicking on the header.

(43,171.05) = 24.74 ( Zamp tax is different now since we are not using the stripe intergration now) In regards to the different amount of transactions with the automation, Zamp is importing 502 additional transactions. Most of them are a transaction and then supplemental voided transactions. There are 59 unaccounted-for transactions that I suspect are listed as a "" Failed or Not-paid"" status . River was filtering those out before posting them to the Google Sheet.

Once Stripe Tax is enabled, it will be in effect from that date/time forward. I'm not 100% sure if it's necessary for you all here, so I have a few questions to ensure we're all on the same page. Enabling Stripe Tax will have various associated costs, which they cover in their documentation . Here is some other important information about Stripe Tax and the different pieces involved. If you'd prefer to schedule a quick call, please use my scheduling link here: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min . Questions: 1) Has Vapi been collecting sales in any way in the past and till now? If not, we won't need the Stripe Tax options enabled to obtain historical data. 2) Was Vapi planning to use Zamp for tax calculations, Stripe Tax, or a different solution? Depending on the systems and situation, we recommend using Stripe Tax as the tax collection solution in your nexus states. 3) Can you provide an export of all columns from the payments page for a date range back to 1/1/2023?",hi Nancy Tyler thank update great question Stripe Tax enable effect date time forward 100 sure necessary question ensure page Enabling Stripe Tax associated cost cover documentation important information Stripe Tax different piece involve prefer schedule quick use scheduling link question 1 Vapi collect sale way past till will need Stripe Tax option enable obtain historical datum 2 Vapi plan use Zamp tax calculation Stripe Tax different solution depend system situation recommend Stripe Tax tax collection solution nexus state 3 provide export column payment page date range 1/1/2023
