**Actors Involved:**

*   **Vapi.ai (Punch Financial):** Tyler (Director of Corporate Services), Nancy, Alex Duong
*   **Zamp:** Chris (primary contact), Nick, Becky (Onboarding Specialist)
*   **Stripe:** Referenced as the solution for Stripe Tax enablement.

**Main Issue/Request:**

Vapi AI (operating under Punch Financial) requires assistance with enabling Stripe Tax functionality and performing comprehensive sales tax nexus analysis. This includes:

*   Enabling Stripe Tax within their system.
*   Obtaining historical transaction data from January 1, 2023, for accurate calculations.
*   Performing a thorough economic nexus analysis to ensure compliance.
*   Addressing issues related to previous data imports and ensuring complete historical data is included in the analysis.
*   Resolving missing early payment export notices.

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   It was determined that utilizing Stripe Tax as their solution for tax calculation is the best approach.
*   Zamp will handle the historical nexus analysis automatically, leveraging existing processes.
*   Chris (Zamp) acknowledged the initial request and clarified the implications of enabling Stripe Tax regarding effective dates/times and associated costs.

**Actions Taken/Planned:**

The following actions have been taken or are planned to address Vapi AI’s requests:

*   **Stripe Tax Enablement:** Chris (Zamp) confirmed enablement of Stripe Tax is in progress.
*   **Data Export & Import:**  Chris provided a data export from Zamp covering the period from January 1, 2023. Alex Duong supplied raw transaction data via an Excel file for import into Zamp. The Zamp team is currently attempting to import this data and requires a password for a protected sheet and specific address/zip code information for accurate sales tax calculations.
*   **Historical Data Correction:** Nick was tasked with sending new data, likely for comparison purposes, after identifying a previous omission.  He is coordinating with Becky (Onboarding Specialist) to ensure the missing enterprise invoice is included in the Nexus analysis.
*   **Invoice & Analysis:** Chris received Alex’s invoice and is following up on the data import request. Zamp will perform historical nexus analysis automatically.
*   **Documentation & Call:** Chris plans to provide documentation regarding Stripe Tax enablement and schedule a call with Tyler (Vapi AI) and Nancy to discuss further details, costs, and timelines.
*   **Payment Notices:** The issue of missing early payment export notices is being investigated.



**Current Status:**

The request is actively in progress with several ongoing tasks:

*   The Zamp team is currently working on importing the provided data from Alex Duong and awaiting a password and address details to complete the import process.
*   Nick is handling the import task, coordinating with Becky for invoice inclusion and Nexus analysis.
*   Documentation preparation and scheduling of a follow-up call are pending.
*   Resolution of the missing early payment export notices remains outstanding.","stripe-questions, nexus-thresholds, filing-data-review"

Hi River welcome thank update appreciate add address pull datum Google Sheet transaction import right tax estimate send morning include miss manual process end implement change avoid future send update tax estimate late import complete tomorrow morning database scale initiative system bit back moment stay update glad thing run smoothly thank collaboration","## Comprehensive Summary of Customer Support Conversation with Ridepanda (River)

This comprehensive summary consolidates information from multiple partial summaries regarding ongoing issues and support interactions with Ridepanda, specifically River. The core problem revolves around discrepancies between data in Google Sheets, ZAMP (likely a financial management platform), and Stripe, compounded by technical challenges related to database migrations and address errors.

**Actors Involved:**

*   **River (Ridepanda):** The customer experiencing the issues and actively collaborating with support.
*   **Chris:** A primary support engineer investigating and addressing the problems.
*   **Support Team:**  A broader team involved in discussions, planning, and potentially implementing solutions.



**Main Issue/Request:**

The overarching issue is significant data discrepancies between Ridepanda's financial records (tracked in Google Sheets) and ZAMP’s reporting, particularly concerning subtotals, taxes, gross sales, discounts, and overall amounts. These differences appear to be driven by inconsistencies in how ZAMP handles Stripe transactions compared to Ridepanda's accrual-based accounting practices, including the impact of voided transactions, payment failures, and uncollectible subscriptions.  Additionally, there were specific instances of individual transaction import failures (Transaction 4753) and incorrect user address data causing invoice processing errors. A brief, unclear exchange suggests a separate issue involving something being ""sent back"" which requires further context to understand fully.

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   The team decided to proceed with the Stripe integration despite the discrepancies, acknowledging they are likely due to differences in accounting methods and transaction handling (cash vs. accrual).
*   A plan was made to align ZAMP’s Stripe integration with Ridepanda's accrual-based accounting practices.
*   It was determined that a manual fix would be applied to correct the incorrect user address data.



**Actions Taken/Planned:**

*   **Stripe Integration Investigation:** Chris is investigating the relevant Stripe code related to invoice transformation and voided/uncollectible statuses, with plans for a thorough update to River tomorrow morning. A meeting has been scheduled to discuss the Stripe integration path forward.
*   **CSV Integration Review:** The team is investigating differences in CSV data between ZAMP and Stripe.
*   **Payment Failure & Uncollectible Subscription Analysis:**  The support team is exploring how Ridepanda handles payment failures and uncollectible subscriptions.
*   **Transaction Import Investigation:** Chris investigated the failed import (Transaction 4753) and suspects it's related to a temporary database migration scale issue. He will continue investigating this underlying problem.
*   **Address Error Prevention:** A manual correction was made to the incorrect user address, and a change is planned to prevent future address errors for identifiable user groups.
*   **Tax Estimate Update:**  A tax estimate update, detailing the manual process used, will be sent in the morning.
*   **Ongoing Communication & Updates:** Chris snoozed the ticket for further discussion with River, indicating ongoing communication and a need for clarification on Ridepanda's processes.



**Current Status:**

The situation is actively under investigation. While immediate issues like the incorrect address have been resolved manually, the core data discrepancies related to Stripe integration remain unresolved and require further analysis and potential code modifications within ZAMP. A large volume of transactions (3750+) are expected to be processed through Stripe, highlighting the importance of resolving these inconsistencies. The brief exchange at the end suggests a positive outlook on a separate, currently unclear issue, but requires more context for full understanding.","stripe-questions, technical-bugs-errors, csv"

Hi Adam welcome thank response move forward filing January 2025 period reach improve Quickbooks Online integration available","## Comprehensive Summary of Customer Support Conversation Regarding Sales Tax and QuickBooks Online Integration

**Actors Involved:** The conversation primarily involves Adam (the customer, representing RentAll Construction Inc.) and Chris (Zamp support representative), with contributions from Zamp's technical and engineering teams.

**Main Issue/Request:** Adam is experiencing significant issues related to sales tax data management within the Zamp platform, specifically concerning automated imports from QuickBooks Online (QBO). The core problems include discrepancies between Zamp’s calculated sales tax estimates for January 2025 across multiple states (Texas, Illinois, Alabama, Connecticut) and the corresponding data in QBO, ranging from minor differences ($100-$200) to substantial variations (e.g., TX: $10,523.17, IL: $5,980.26). Adam initially requested assistance pulling sales tax data directly from QBO and understanding why it wasn’t readily available for export or reporting.  He also expressed concerns about state-specific sales tax estimates and rounding differences.

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   **Temporary Disablement of Automated Import:** At Adam's request, the automatic import of QBO invoice data into Zamp has been temporarily disabled.
*   **Manual CSV Import:** Adam will now manually export transaction data from QBO and import it into Zamp using CSV files.
*   **January 2025 Filing Agreement:**  Zamp is proceeding with filing state sales taxes for January 2025 based on agreed-upon amounts: Illinois ($5,875.00), Texas ($10,345.16), Alabama ($2,156.42). Chris will review and approve the filing button for February returns.
*   **Investigation of QBO Data Access:** The technical team is investigating why sales tax data isn't readily accessible from QBO within Zamp and exploring options to provide Adam with a detailed state-specific report (potentially via screenshot).
*   **Future Integration Improvements:**  Zamp plans to improve the QuickBooks Online integration in the future.

**Actions Taken/Planned:**

*   **Technical Investigation:** The technical team is actively investigating the QBO data access issue, reviewing transaction logs, attempting queries in Metabase, and examining Alloy Zapier integration. A detailed update on this investigation is expected February 15th.
*   **Manual Data Review & Filing Preparation:** Chris plans to begin filing Wednesday morning (February 5th) and will review the filing button for February returns. Adam will investigate the QBO data discrepancies. Zamp will provide a sales tax estimate to Adam.
*   **CSV Import Implementation:** Adam is preparing to manually export data from QBO and import it into Zamp via CSV.
*   **Documentation Review:** Chris has reviewed transaction logs, attempted queries in Metabase, investigated issues related to Alloy Zapier integration, and is currently reviewing a summary document provided by Adam.



**Current Status:** The immediate issue of automated imports has been addressed through temporary disablement.  The conversation remains ongoing with a focus on reconciling sales tax estimates, addressing the QBO data discrepancies, and understanding why direct access to QBO sales tax information isn't available within Zamp. A detailed update regarding the technical investigation into QBO data access is pending for February 15th. Adam confirmed readiness to proceed with manual data import and filing.","qbo-questions, filing-data-review, csv"

Hi Jessica thank update date leave Nordstrom ideal break information import later date thank","Here's a concise summary of the customer support conversation:

**Main Issue/Request:** UpCounting (Jessica Pearcey) requested a January 2025 CSV file for Zamp wholesale orders (account 9330 5639 Quebec Inc.) to facilitate timely filing and order import. They also needed a tax estimate.

**Key Decisions Made:** Jessica initially forgot to specify the date range (Jan 1-31) for the data, which was later clarified. It was agreed that breaking down the information by state would be ideal but could be implemented at a later date due to its complexity.

**Actions Taken/Planned:** Zamp acknowledged the request and committed to sending the January data file with a tax estimate as soon as possible. They are working on incorporating state-level breakdowns for future reports.

**Current Status:** The January CSV file is being prepared and will be sent shortly. The Nordstrom transaction data, including zip code, city, and state, is now confirmed. The request for state-specific breakdown has been noted for a later implementation.","csv, filing-data-review, tax-calculations"

welcome Tra anytime great thank quick approval wonderful evening","## Comprehensive Summary of Underdog Sports Holdings Sales Tax Issue

**Actors Involved:**

*   **Tra Pham (Controller, Underdog Sports Holdings Inc.):** The customer initiating the support requests and providing transaction details. Contacted via email.
*   **Zamp Support Team:** Primarily **Zamp**, **Aimee Moore (amoore@zamp.com)**, and **Chris**. Responsible for investigating and resolving the sales tax issues.

**Main Issue/Request:**

Underdog Sports Holdings Inc., represented by Tra Pham, is experiencing discrepancies with their January 2025 sales tax filings in Connecticut (CT) and Virginia (VA). The core issue revolves around a missing or incorrectly entered refund related to transaction GILS1477, potentially impacting their tax liability and requiring a manual refund. While the CT filing appears approved, the VA filing presents a significant problem with an apparent offset refund discrepancy (-$3.91 sale) and a potential impact on gross sales ($1034.343).

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   Zamp will investigate the Virginia (VA) filing issue, focusing on reconciliation of posted refunds and verifying amounts.
*   A refund request for transaction GILS1477 related to a negative sales tax in Hampton City, VA was approved.
*   The team needs to determine why the refund isn't showing up in VA reports and calculate the correct offset amount.

**Actions Taken/Planned:**

*   **Virginia Filing Investigation (General):** Zamp is reviewing the VA filing and transaction history, including checking for a ""magic math banner"" adjustment related to gross sales. Aimee Moore requested the transaction ID from Tra Pham to facilitate this investigation.
*   **Transaction GILS1477 Specific Research:** Chris is researching order GILS1477 across December 2024 - January 2025 using Metabase, comparing VA reports and investigating a potential connection to Zamp's export/import process.  He has identified a possible cause related to local jurisdiction negative transactions (-$3.91).
*   **Refund Approval & Documentation:** Zamp will handle the approved refund request for transaction GILS1477. Documentation outlining the submission steps will be provided to Tra Pham.
*   **Further Testing:** The team is exploring whether similar issues are present in other customer accounts, potentially indicating a broader system problem.

**Current Status:**

The issue remains actively under investigation. While the CT filing appears resolved, resolving the VA filing discrepancies and ensuring the correct refund posting for transaction GILS1477 is ongoing.  The refund request itself has been approved and is awaiting finalization and documentation delivery by Friday, February 14th, 2025. The customer is asked to remain patient while the investigation continues.","filing-data-review, notices-correspondence, tax-calculations"

Here's a comprehensive summary combining the information from both partial summaries, focusing on actors, issues, decisions, actions, and current status.

**Actors Involved:**

*   **nkondak@zamp.com (Customer):** Representing Zamp, primarily concerned with sales tax filings.
*   **Chris (Zamp Technical Success Team):** Requesting assistance regarding an acquisition and data access.
*   **Emily (Support Representative):** Responsible for connecting Amelia, retrieving transaction data, providing a tax estimate, and facilitating the sales tax filing review process.
*   **Amelia:**  Recipient of a connection from Emily, presumably related to the acquisition.
*   **Support Team (General):** Involved in reviewing and approving Zamp's sales tax filings.

**Main Issue/Request:**

This conversation encompasses two distinct but interconnected requests:

1.  **Sales Tax Filing Review & Approval (nkondak@zamp.com):** The customer is requesting a thorough review and approval of Zamp’s February 1st sales tax filings, ensuring accuracy across multiple states and confirmation that sufficient funds are available for remittance. They need assurance everything ""looks good"" before finalizing the filing process, aiming to begin on Wednesday morning (February 5th).
2.  **Acquisition Data Access & Tax Estimate (Chris):** Chris from Zamp’s Technical Success Team requires Emily to connect Amelia and facilitate access to transaction data for a specific acquisition. He also urgently needs a sales tax estimate provided by 9:45 EST, followed by an updated version as soon as possible.

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   **Sales Tax Filing Review Focus:** The support team will prioritize reviewing the accuracy of state filings and ensuring Zamp notices are included in the approved filing.

*   **Sales Tax Filing Review & Approval:** The support team will review and approve the February 1st sales tax filings, add a Zamp notice, and confirm access to state portals. A detailed sales tax estimate for January 2025 across multiple states (totaling $19,628.45) has already been provided.
*   **Acquisition Data Access:** Emily will connect Amelia and retrieve the necessary transaction data related to the acquisition. She is also tasked with providing a preliminary tax estimate by 9:45 EST, followed by an updated version.

**Current Status:**

*   **Sales Tax Filing Review:** Awaiting final review and approval of the February 1st sales tax filings.  Confirmation is desired by Tuesday, February 4th.

**Actors Involved:** The primary contact is Mike Kupka, representing Basics Etc Corp.  Support agents involved include Ashley, Chris (Zamp), Lucas, and Ryan. Technical Success and Mike (potentially a different Mike) are also contributing to the resolution.

**Main Issue/Request:** Basics Etc Corp (Mike Kupka) is experiencing multiple interconnected issues related to sales tax filings and data discrepancies within the Zamp system. Initially, Mike needed assistance accessing Nevada state accounts and obtaining login credentials and authentication codes.  Beyond Nevada, the core problem revolves around a significant discrepancy between estimated and collected sales tax amounts ($42,507.87 vs. $40,575 initially reported, later refined to $40,720.24 in a Zamp report for Q1 2025). This discrepancy is compounded by difficulties receiving or confirming receipt of a Utah PIN and concerns about an SLS tax note from March.  A key underlying challenge involves complex timezone handling during transaction ingestion, storage, and reporting.

**Key Decisions Made:** Several decisions have been made to address these issues:

*   Immediate focus on resolving Mike's Nevada access problems (login, authentication code, submission confirmation).
*   Initiation of a thorough investigation into the sales tax discrepancy, suspecting a time zone difference (UTC vs. PST) and reconciliation issues between Zamp and Shopify as contributing factors.
*   Consideration of using ""transaction date send"" instead of the filing client API date to potentially resolve data discrepancies.
*   Exploration of exporting transaction data via a calculation endpoint (.txt format) for direct comparison.
*   Potential standardization on UTC offsets for transactions while allowing users to view them in their local timezone (e.g., PST).
*   Investigation into Zamp's API behavior, specifically the `transactionrecalculate = true` setting and exploring non-API integration options for collection reporting.

**Actions Taken/Planned:** The following actions have been taken or are planned:

*   Nevada registration information and authentication codes were sent to Mike.
*   Confirmation of January 2025 Nevada sales tax return submission was provided.
*   Chris (Zamp) is leading an investigation into the sales tax difference, analyzing transaction data exports and comparing them directly with Shopify data.
*   Technical Success has been asked to provide documentation regarding API differences.
*   Lucas and Ryan are potentially involved due to timezone complexities in report building.
*   Reviewing Q1 2025 (particularly March 2025) transaction data, exporting variance reports (`taxdue` vs `taxcollected`), and investigating the Zamp API's recalculation behavior.
*   Mike is assisting with logging the request for a calculation endpoint export and investigating its feasibility.
*   Follow-up is needed regarding the Utah PIN, as Mike believes he may have recently received it via text.

**Current Status:** The situation is complex and involves multiple ongoing efforts:

*   Mike's access to Nevada accounts appears resolved.
*   The primary outstanding issue remains confirming receipt of the Utah PIN.
*   A comprehensive investigation into the sales tax discrepancy is underway, with a target response date of Friday, April 25th, to prevent filing delays and potential penalties.
*   Technical teams are actively exploring solutions related to timezone management, data export options, and reconciliation methods. The complexity of timezone handling is acknowledged as a significant challenge.","registration-documents, filing-data-review, shopify-data-reconciliation"

**Actors Involved:** The customer, Chingee Tan from Joolca, and Zamp support agents Becky and Chris (from the Technical Success Team).

**Main Issue/Request:** Chingee Tan is experiencing multiple interconnected issues requiring significant support. These include: 1) Formatting data reports into a Zamp-compatible CSV format for transaction processing, 2) Updating and verifying Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) settings, 3) Resolving missing information needed for Avalara filings, 4) Addressing several state-specific login and registration problems (California, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, Vermont, Virginia), and 5) Experiencing difficulties importing transaction data into Zamp.  A key concern is the potential for penalties due to late filing of January transactions.

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   Becky prioritized resolving the Avalara filing issues and state-specific login/registration problems.
*   It was confirmed that Chingee’s data reports need translation into a specific Zamp CSV format, requiring adherence to column order and value matching against a template.
*   The urgency of updating 2FA settings before February 15th was acknowledged to ensure proper processing of March/February transaction files.
*   Chris agreed to review the customer’s provided CSV file containing transaction details to identify and resolve import errors.

**Actions Taken/Planned:**

*   Chris shared instructions on how to properly format the CSV file for Zamp compatibility.
*   Chingee successfully added 2FA via email, with a test email forwarded for verification.  Confirmation of STP email forwarding is pending.
*   A follow-up meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM AEST between Chingee and Becky to address the Avalara filing issues and state-specific login/registration problems. An update email will be sent following this meeting.
*   Chris identified missing data (amount, transactionSubtotal, transactionTotal) in 136 transactions within the provided CSV file. He requested an XLSX version of the file with filtered rows and screenshots highlighting problematic transactions to facilitate troubleshooting.
*   Chingee confirmed that ""$0"" entries are valid and will provide updated February data.



**Current Status:** The situation remains complex and requires ongoing support. 

*   The initial 2FA setup is complete, pending verification of STP email forwarding functionality.
*   The January transaction filing issue and potential penalties remain unresolved and require further investigation.
*   The CSV data formatting request is in progress, awaiting Chingee’s application of Chris's instructions and the provision of a revised XLSX file with supporting screenshots.
*   Resolution of Avalara filings and state-specific login/registration issues are prioritized for tomorrow morning’s meeting.","filing-data-review, overdue-filing, csv, registration-question"

**Actors Involved:** This conversation involves multiple parties including Kaley (Cult Gaia, kpomeroy@cultgaia.com), Chris (Zamp representative), Jackie and Tasia (Cult Gaia e-commerce teams), Ashley (Loop Exchange), and potentially members of the Zamp engineering team.

**Main Issue/Request:** Cult Gaia (Cult Gaia) is experiencing significant and complex discrepancies between their internal sales data (including POS transactions) managed by Zamp and Shopify's reporting, impacting international transaction exports, tax calculations, and overall financial accuracy. The core issues revolve around:

*   **Data Export Timing & Accuracy:** A request for a specific Shopify data export for January 2025 with defined time windows was initially made and subsequently adjusted to Tuesday, March 4th, 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM PST.
*   **International Transaction Reporting Errors:**  Specifically impacting POS transactions, refunds, and tax calculations within Shopify's international setup. This includes discrepancies between January ($47,110.05 difference) and February ($3,737.42 & $3,165.80 differences).
*   **Loop Exchange Order Duplicates:**  Duplicate entries for Loop Exchange orders are causing incorrect sales tax calculations and requiring manual adjustments.
*   **General Data Mismatches:** Discrepancies in transaction reporting between Zamp's internal systems and Shopify exports, potentially stemming from timezone differences, import details, and the handling of refunds (taxable vs. non-taxable).

**Key Decisions Made:** To address these issues, several key decisions have been made:

*   **Export Timing Adjustment:** The initial data export timeframe was adjusted to accommodate Cult Gaia’s team availability.
*   **Tax Engine & Loop Discount Adjustments:**  The Shopify tax engine account will be adjusted, and Loop discounts will be temporarily disabled.
*   **Integration Strategy:** Exploring a NetSuite/Shopify integration via Celigo and upgrading AvaTax are planned for long-term solutions.
*   **Manual Workarounds:** Implementing manual adjustments, including refund offsets and providing temporary tax estimates, to address immediate reporting needs.
*   **Reporting Tool Exploration:** Investigating the use of `shopifyql` for future report building capabilities.
*   **Feature Request Submission:** A feature request will be submitted to Zamp's engineering team to resolve the underlying issue causing duplicate tax calculations related to Loop Exchange orders and AvaTax integration.

**Actions Taken/Planned:**  A wide range of actions are underway or planned:

*   **Data Analysis & Investigation:** Chris is conducting a detailed data analysis, examining transaction data from December 2024 - February 2025 (website vs. POS), filtering by date and shipping location, using techniques like VLOOKUP to identify duplicates, and creating offset refund transactions.
*   **Shopify Export Review & Filtering:**  The Shopify report needs further tweaking and filtering, including potentially incorporating POS sales data into the export and sorting by POS sale existence.
*   **Tax Settings Adjustments:** Adjusting tax settings within Shopify is planned.
*   **Follow-up Meetings:** Scheduled follow-up meetings with Ashley (Loop Exchange) to discuss order duplicates and taxes.
*   **Calendar Invites:** Calendar invites have been sent for the data export confirmation and follow-up discussions.
*   **Tax Estimate Delivery:** A tax estimate will be delivered on March 12th.
*   **ShopifyQL Training:** The customer will receive information about `shopifyql`.

**Current Status:**  The situation remains ongoing, with multiple investigations and adjustments in progress. While a data export for January 2025 is scheduled, the core issues of reporting discrepancies and international transaction errors require continued investigation and resolution. The initial estimate for overpayment due to these discrepancies is $50,001.50.  The team is working towards adjusting future filings and identifying missing orders from Shopify while implementing temporary workarounds. A long-term solution involving engineering adjustments and integration improvements is also being pursued.","shopify-data-reconciliation, filing-data-review, shopify-questions"

**Actors Involved:**

*   **Compliatric (Belva Zmerzlikar):** The customer experiencing the issue and primary point of contact.
*   **Zamp Support Team:**  Including Aimee Moore, Chris, and Ryan; responsible for investigating and resolving the discrepancies.
*   **Zamp Engineering Team:** Involved in deleting specific invoices from the system.

**Main Issue/Request:**

Compliatric is experiencing significant discrepancies between sales tax estimates provided by Zamp for January 2025 and their actual bills received. These issues are impacting multiple states, specifically Arizona, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana.  Belva Zmerzlikar initially requested the deletion of several problematic invoices (10928, 11048, 10984) due to errors and missing data, alongside clarification on how to delete invoices within the system generally. She also sought approval for an invoice totaling $1,496.00. The root cause appears to be a combination of incorrect tax calculations, potential data card issues (specifically flagged in Arizona), and challenges with syncing between Zamp and QuickBooks Online (QBO).

**Key Decisions Made:**

*   Zamp will thoroughly investigate the discrepancies in sales tax calculations across all affected states (Arizona, West Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana).
*   Instead of deleting invoices, a decision was made to void the $1,496 invoice and explore alternative deletion methods, potentially involving Ryan.  A QBO integration may also impact future deletion processes.
*   The problematic invoices 10928, 11048, and 10984 will be deleted from the system by the Zamp engineering team.
*   Zamp is preparing a revised tax estimate for January 2025 filings, incorporating South Carolina ($1,804.42) and Louisiana ($468.40) sales taxes.
*   A scheduling link has been sent to Belva for a meeting to review the Arizona invoice (INV-10928) and related QBO reports.
*   Exploring a CSV connection as an interim solution for managing invoice deletions and generating tax estimates, mirroring the current process for credit memos.

**Actions Taken/Planned:**

*   Zamp is investigating the root cause of the discrepancies, including reviewing QBO reports and potentially modifying transactions in Zamp.
*   Aimee Moore acknowledged receipt of updated bill information and will provide further details shortly.
*   The engineering team has been requested to delete invoices 10928, 11048, and 10984.
*   A corrected invoice (10929) similar to the Arizona invoice is being prepared.
*   Chris marked the initial approval request as pending, stopped the invoice process, and will consult with Ryan regarding deletion procedures.
*   Chris is investigating a CSV connection solution for Belva’s needs.
*   An export containing relevant data has been provided.
*   A revised tax estimate will be sent once complete.



**Current Status:**

The issue remains under investigation by the Zamp team. Invoice deletion requests are in progress, and a revised tax estimate is being prepared. A meeting with Belva is scheduled to review the Arizona invoice and QBO reports.  Belva will also receive updates within a week regarding the CSV solution for managing invoices and generating estimates. The initial approval request ($1,496) remains pending while Zamp explores alternative deletion methods.","filing-data-review, qbo-questions, tax-calculations"
