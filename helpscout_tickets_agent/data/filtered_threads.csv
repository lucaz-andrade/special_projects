3094012417,191184,9445011291,note,2025-10-06T15:39:13Z,chris@zamp.com,"@ashleyD - The difference will likely be due to Marketkplace transactions. So far, that appears to be the case. That said, I think we're missing some 2024 transactions because we only had 2024 data from Shopify starting at 11/1/25. That could be correct, though. I just started a bulk sync for all of 2024: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cm6sd9zou00h7k403meqvyhz1/integrations/cm7uvns87000103ji0ev8fzxp I've also attached a file showing their CO Transactions for 2024 through 2025. We're seeing a total of $86k, with only approximately $ 69k of that being non-marketplace. Most of this is in 2025 as well."

We would need the Shopify Order Name (e.g., #160896) or the Shopify Order ID (6198526509127) to determine if we can assist them here, as the Subscription IDs they shared must be coming from a source other than Shopify.

I will be out of the office for most of the day on Oct. 1st but I hope to get you what you need before I go (by around 9:30am).  So, I would like to touch base with you. We have these points of access for sales taxes: Shopify - which you are already hooked up Lightspeed R-Series POS system and Quickbooks Pro+ desktop version.  I think you are collecting my store's sales tax from Lightspeed and combining it with Shopify for you to do our tax filing.  If needed we can look at getting the info from Quickbooks since Lightspeed syncs up with QB. Since you don't do Lightspeed connections I will be sending you a report but I sent an ""all"" transaction report to your techs during onboarding and I think we decided that you don't need ""all"" transactions (there are over a thousand in-store sales) because they are all in Littleton, CO 80123.  So, I want to be clear on which SUMMARY report to send so maybe we could work on that together. Thanks! Kathy Kathy Kent Co-owner/COO 303-870-7901"

We noticed that when we load in and create an invoice, the first one is taking around 5 minutes to get tax in QBO and post to the Zamp Site . Issue: QBO transactions seem to have a 5 minute delay on first invoice. In tested we have seen that there is about a 5 minute delay from Save & Close to tax showing on the invoice in QBO and posting to Zamp Admin. The second and third test we did the time dropped to 2 minutes then on the FOURTH the time dropped to under a minute. Is this expected behavior? If so, anyway we can reduce the time it takes on the first few invoices? Seems it resets back to the 5 minute delay after awhile. If this is intended, what is the duration? TESTING First Invoice: 12:45 - Clicked ""Save & Close"" 12:50 - Showed up on Zamp Admin 12:50 - Showed up in QBO as a line QBO log timestamp - 2025-09-29T19:50:45.8614392Z Second Invoice: 12:53 - Clicked ""Save & Close"" 12:55 - Showed up in Zamp Admin 12:55 - Showed in QBO as a line QBO log timestamp - 2025-09-29T19:55:06.5986541Z Third Invoice: 12:56 - Clicked ""Save & Close"" 12:57 - Showed up in Zamp Admin 12:57 - Showed in QBO as a line QBO log timestamp - 2025-09-29T19:57:48.524Z Fourth Invoice: 1:00 - Clicked ""Save & Close"" 1:00 - Showed up in Zamp Admin 1:00 - Showed in QBO as a line QBO log timestamp - 2025-09-29T20:00:10.903Z Let me know if you have any questions!

Regarding the 2nd address: Which was: 2449 E Genesee St, Syracuse, NY, 13210-2223 On our end, we are showing that the primary or house number, 2449, is invalid here. According to USPS data and Zamp's address data, this is confirmed. This page from Smarty provides additional details. Here's where we can see that the address is invalid: Regarding the 1st address: Which was: 20 W 34th St, New York, NY 10118-0114 This address presents a slightly different story, as further investigation reveals it to be a valid address; however, it is missing an apartment or suite number, which leads to a different determination overall. Smarty's evaluation of the address also indicates a missing apartment or suite number. The USPS shows on this page that there are as many as 5 different address possibilities here: Next steps: This is something that we will raise with our engineering team to explore potential solutions for. As soon as we have more information or an improvement is released, we'll follow up promptly. Our engineering team has been working through a process to improve how invalid or incomplete addresses are handled within Zamp; it's top of mind here. In the meantime, we recommend (if you haven't already) ensuring that your checkout or purchasing process allows orders to proceed in these scenarios. I hope this is helpful to you.

We're working through the differences you've noted, and it's likely due to the nature of Zamp's exports, which are line-item-level files rather than order-level files. We should have an update and another version of these files for your review soon. Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

The difference is likely caused by these exports containing repeated amounts across each row in the CSV file, as they're what we call a 'line item file'. If they add the tax or other amounts starting with 'transaction', it will be larger than the actual tax collected. The transaction-level amounts: Line item amounts (differ from transaction-level): Here's an example: The yellow is one transaction with multiple lines, and we can talk about this today or this week. :) We'll know more as we get a chance to look into this with the Zamp Camp stuff and travel."

So, we're all set regarding the initial tax calculations for the transactions. If we do that, how do we remove the tax from next months calculation for Maryland so we don't pay it? To remove the tax, we would want to create a couple of transactions to offset the tax and ensure it is not paid to the state of Maryland, since the tax was refunded and shouldn't have been collected now that we know the customer is tax-exempt. We can do this in either of the ways noted below: This can be done via the Zamp API (see the attached example JSON files) as these API calls can be sent through the current integration or as one-off transactions using a tool like Postman. I can create transactions by importing the attached CSV file if Bag Borrow or Steal's Zamp integration doesn't currently support doing this via the API. Which of the two paths would you or the team prefer? Please let me know if you have any questions! Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

The other question we had was about refunding the tax for this transaction. The customer has supplied us with their resale certificate so we want to refund the tax on their 2 transactions (this one and 8173260). If we do that, how do we remove the tax from next months calculation for Maryland so we don't pay it?"

I reviewed the API calls for sales tax calculations associated with the Bag Borrow or Steal Zamp account and found that Zamp isn't receiving any values for the discount from Bag Borrow or Steal's custom integration. For example, here is an API call for calculation that was sent on September 18, 2025, 10:23 PM: The discount would need to be provided in the discount property towards the top of the API call below, or on the specific line item under the lineItems.[X].discount property.

} In addition, this customer informed us that they have a resale certificate and will be sending that in. What is the process in Zamp for removing the tax collected from the order if we refund the customer the tax? We shouldn't be sending in a tax payment we didn't truly collect. For this refund, we recommend creating a full refund via Zamp's API, if your integration supports this, and then recreating the transaction without tax. The purpose value can be set to RESALE. If the above isn't possible here, we could delete the existing transaction within Zamp and recreate it without the tax, ensuring that the tax that wasn't collected is not remitted. Which of the above options works best for you all? Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

You can see the details below, but we only charge/receive the amount less the discount (or in our system we call it the 'discounted amount').  If this is true, it needs to be fixed immediately for any state that is calculating (and remitting) this way.  If true, it is possibly why we are meeting the thresholds so quickly because we generally sell items at an average of a 23% discount. In addition, this customer informed us that they have a resale certificate and will be sending that in.

We were able to roll forward a few refunds from July 2025 into the August 2025 filing period, but many will need to be carried into future filing periods, and we're keeping track of this. Additionally, the approximately $100 difference between the Zamp Transaction's tax total and our tax-due estimate is due to additional refunds resulting in negative amounts in other local jurisdictions; we're keeping track of those as well. We'll continue to carry or roll these forward as we have done the last few months. I've also confirmed that the ShopMy orders all show $0 tax in both Shopify and Zamp as we expected. Zamp's Shopify integration continues to account for voided orders partially and adequately account for partial refunds. Any discrepancies with partial refunds were manually accounted for. I've attached two files: The transaction-level and totals for the tax-due estimate review. The work and supporting transaction file, along with notes for the usual month-to-month order edit and partial refund process. Please let us know if you have any questions. Have a great weekend!

This is the current logic when the connector is live as it doesn't save over to the ZAMP side until it's moved to a completed status. For the historical sync we should be taking the data as is from their WooCommerce instance, as the assumption is that these have already been paid so adding tax to them wouldn't be helpful. With this, and the inclusion of the random characters after the WC order number, if you resync the same period of transactions you get duplicates posted to the Zamp side. We need some sort of checking on this to avoid duplicates. Thanks! John"

Please let us know if our understanding is correct. As you mentioned above fetch processing, completed, refunded, or pending payment in historical /transaction sync. transactedAt should be date created when sending transaction to Zamp For Completed and refunded status , first perform tax calculation using /calculations endpoint , store taxDue amount and perform /transactions call with taxDue as taxCollected value. If Orders which are in completed or refunded Status - We cannot update anything in WooCommerce as the document are locked If Orders are in any other status like processing or pending payment , perform tax calculation using /calculations endpoint and update tax values back in wooCommerce - We need to verify if we can update tax back in WooCommerce.

Did you check the Zamp plugin settings to make sure Indiana was set as a state to tax with there? Also, your production site is already using the shortcode for checkout while your staging site is using blocks . Can you modify your ""checkout now"" page to use a blocks layout and not shortcode ? If you would like, happy to get on a call and go through this as well. Thanks! John"

I went into your staging site to create a secondary checkout page that uses shortcode to see if I can make it do the duplicate tax issue, but the site is giving me cc errors on checkout even though no CC processor is enabled. Can you either look into this error on your staging site so we can test there to see if we can get the duplicate tax or set up a temp checkout on your production site that uses blocks and not shortcode ?

I've attached the file we reviewed and worked with during our call today. The 'Transaction Subtotal' amounts and formulas we discussed are in columns AA and AB. I've also updated the formulas on the 'Instructions' sheet. A few items we discussed, and I said I would share via email: The transactionSubtotal (column ' G ') should be the combined (summed) total of all line items on the invoice; it can be repeated across each row. 🙂 Columns AA and AB , along with the instructions sheet, can help with this. If an item has a discount on an invoice, let's include this discount in column ' U ', labeled ' lineItemDiscount '. We want to ensure we don't include the discount in column ' H ' for ' transactionDiscoun t' to avoid duplication. If shipping and handling (freight) charges are associated with an invoice, let's include that amount in column ' F ' for ' transactionShippingHandlin g'. We also want to ensure we don't include the shipping/handling amount in column ' W ' for ' lineItemShippingHandling ' to avoid duplication. For installations, we want to include the R_SRV_INSTALLATION tax code in column ' Y ' for ' lineItemProductTaxCode '. The discount amounts should be positive for invoices and negative for refunds. All amounts for an invoice (in each row and column) should be positive . All amounts for a refund (in each row and column) should be negative . I hope this is helpful! Please let us know if you have any questions! Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

System Comparisons: We determined that QB was the best source for accurate tax calculations and any small variance from what is reflected in SalesForce was immaterial with the general understanding that less than 5% variance was in the realm of tolerable and reasonable.  This being said, I have reviewed data in each system and can confirm QB is the correct data source. ZAMP template: ZAMP was to send me a detailed template and be available for a call if needed.  I do not recall receiving the template.  If sent, please resend.  In the meantime, I ran a report in QB that I think provides the information you need to calculate and file our Sales & Use taxes.  Please see attached CSVs: QB REPORT - 2025-08 This report is in its raw form directly from QuickBooks.  You can see that there are duplications that will skew the taxes, etc. ZAMP - Sales & Use 2025-08 This is a cleaner version of the QB report with duplicate data removed, etc.  The ""Ship via"" column is actually the method of transferring the product from ILE to the customer.  ""ILE Installation"" equates to taxes assessed on COGs or purchase price.  Any other classification under ""Ship via"" (i.e. Customer Pickup) equates to taxes assessed on the sale price.  Some items, such as storage fees and trip charge, are not taxable, so there is no value in the ""Taxation Target"" column. Once provided, I can fill out the template with necessary codes, etc., but I hope this data gives you some idea of what we might provide in our steps to make the transition of responsibility for preparing and filing taxes.  I recall you mentioning that you are working on an integration with QB, but it is not yet ready.  In the interim, I am hoping we might do manual exchanges to get the ball moving in the right direction. Please consider and advise.  Please share with others (i.e. Chris Ralph?) as needed.

PayPal doesn't have a way to share address information and tax info via the Express integration or APIs. There's a hidden state-specific tax rate configuration option that must be set up manually, and it only allows single rates. Ultimately, Gus noted that they will likely decide not to use PayPal as a payment method, but they will discuss this internally with their team. Either way, they will send all transactions to Zamp, and if they do use PayPal, they will be under-collecting tax and paying the difference out of pocket because of PayPal's limitations.

Notes from investigation with @nick : Vetchy isn't using any tags on orders with returns or exchanges through Rich Returns - I'll likely ask them to configure this just in case it's necessary in the future. Rich returns documentation: https://support.richreturns.io/en/articles/9272102-shopify-sync#:~:text=Add-,a%20tag%20to%20the%20order,-%2C%20which%20can%20be We'll likely want a call with them to confirm their Rich Returns settings within that app/separate site's Dashboard and settings: https://support.richreturns.io/en/articles/9272487-exchange-orders-shopify-sales-statistics-analytics I spot-checked various refunded and partially refunded orders and found: Rich Returns is using Shopify's built-in return/exchange functionality. Zamp is capturing these orders, both the order and the refund. The refunds can sometimes span pretty large date ranges: V2389481 - Order on 7/7 but return on 8/29. V2375531 - Ordered on 7/5 but returned on 8/29. V2172421 - Ordered on 5/29 but returned 8/3. We may want to review the FAQ and other Rich Returns support articles here: https://support.richreturns.io/en/collections/9390062-faqs https://support.richreturns.io/en/ We're handling partial refunds, full refunds, and returns/exchanges correctly here. In the past, we may not have been aware of these changes, as they were released between June and July 2025. We'll likely encounter issues with negative amounts in a filing's local jurisdictions fairly regularly, especially from July through September."

Other states - lots of refunds, specifically - GA, OK, LA, SC and VA. Order edits? They rarely make changes - someone in customer care/support might do something. Sometimes they have a manual order, where they issue an express shipping to the customer. they do not change orders like this. Loop or return/exchange apps: They don't use third-party apps. Returns specifically: They have plenty of returns and exchanges. They have close to 20% on returns, from orders/sales. Sizing issues and other various reasons. They want to make sure when we file, that we're accounting for those. Return policy is usually ~18 days - they say 2 weeks, and they usually give 18. With returns - it's 30-days. They have a seasonal business July is a peak season and in August they have a lot of returns. Returns are more than gross sales in August, but it's up there. A lot of retunrs in general, so August is still the highest - not above gross sales but close to. They use a platform called RichCommerce - https://apps.shopify.com/rich-returns They sync with Shopify -"

We were able to adjust Vetchy's transaction data to align with the tax-due estimate below. This is still approximately $726 higher than Shopify's estimated tax. That said, many of the differences you've noted appear to be related to a high number of refund transactions (returns) in various states, which can make the situation complicated because no US state allows negative amounts to be reported on their sales tax returns. This includes the state-level and local-level. We have some ideas and paths forward that can help with adjusting for this in future filing periods, though. I have most of the refund transactions (returns) tracked on our end. Could we schedule a call to discuss these options and determine if there are any other reasons for these differences to occur? Here's our scheduling link. To ensure timely filing, we have initiated the filing process for all of Vetchy's sales tax returns.

Hi Jackie, A quick follow-up here! First, I hope that you're doing well and that your weekend was enjoyable! I've attached a supporting documentation file that contains a few new things we discussed last month, for refund transactions that need to be carried into future filing periods. Here's some details about the attached file: The first sheet contains all of the transactions included in the August 2025 filing period. The 2nd and 3rd sheets contain the refunds from July and August 2025 that could not be accounted for because they caused negative amounts on filings (which states don't allow). The blue-highlighted rows are refunds that we brought into August 2025 from July 2025. On the July 2025 sheet (the second one), the unhighlighted rows represent refunds that we're tracking to bring into a future filing period (likely September 2025). On the August 2025 sheet (the 3rd one), the green highlighted rows are refund Transactions we're tracking to bring into a future filing period (likely September and October 2025.) The Final two sheets within this file show tax totals by state and the Zamp Tax-Due Estimate. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback about this. I'm happy to hop on a call or be available to discuss at 513-504-1463 if I can help clarify anything.

I will let our team know that we need to recalculate Zamp's estimated tax due for Sauce's subscription transactions to ensure that the amount is paid out of pocket. Once Sauce is collecting tax and no longer requires these recalculations, please let us know, and we'll update our process accordingly. I have done this for the August 2025 filing period, and two states (including TX) had updated tax-due estimates: Texas August 2025 - $53.59 with $25.98 due for subscriptions. Rhode Island August 2025 - $10.43 , which is all allocated to subscriptions. Could you please confirm if we have your approval to proceed with these filings this month?

We've confirmed that all subscription and transaction revenue transactions were imported into Zamp. Please note that all of these transactions were imported into Zamp using the zip code for each transaction, as there were mismatches in the city, state, and zip code combinations across many transactions this month and in previous months. For example, pi_3Rxxn2EQM1AIeBGd1cBklSM9 had an invalid zip code of 11921, when it should've been 90064 for the Regarding Texas and your question: TX - are we including the subscriptions? It does not look like they were included. Yes—we've included all of the subscription revenue, although it appears that $0 tax was collected on subscriptions with clients located in TX. These two TX subscription revenue transactions are: py_3Ry49fEXcRdhdpzG1H6sOtxv py_3RrsLsEXcRdhdpzG1h1miFLw I've attached an export of the transactions we see bucketed into the TX tax-due estimate for August 2025; the subscription revenue is highlighted in light blue. Questions: Is the above correct that $0 tax was collected? Does Sauce prefer to pay the tax out of pocket for August 2025 and in future filing periods? We can 'recalculate' the tax for the affected transactions and ensure this is a part of the process from now on. This was done for the overdue sales tax filings."

In this situation, we'd recommend a few different strategies that might help improve load time: Caching the sales tax rate after the initial API call to Zamp, instead of making additional API calls as items are added. One way to do this could be: Storing the taxDue amount from the Zamp /calculations API response and dividing it by the cart's initial amount to obtain the tax rate. Sum the tax rate available as a taxRate property within the Zamp API response's taxes array. Make an initial API call to /calculations to obtain the tax due and present it as an 'estimate', then make the final calculation at Checkout before the payment is processed. Implement a debounce mechanism on cart updates to ensure the API is only called after the user has not interacted with the cart for 500 milliseconds to 1 second. A similar approach could be to batch cart changes into API calls made to Zamp's /calculations API endpoint when the user is idle in the cart or site, or immediately before they proceed. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions. Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

We investigated this further and found that Zamp's tax collected amounts (and the amount for the tax-due estimate that was remitted) align closely with both the Vargo POS and Shopify tax collection for North Carolina and South Carolina. I'll share more details about why this is the case below. The Shopify Report I used is the 'United States Sales Tax' Report , filtered to NC and SC here . The first cause of this difference: Zamp's system had some background processes involved in our internal tax calculation process (to build our filings and estimates) that were slightly backed up in early to mid-September. Our Engineering team resolved this situation after the tax-due estimate was sent. We've also had various internal conversations about improving this situation and ensuring we catch these before our tax-due estimates are sent out. The tax-due estimate for NC has been updated to $ 13,723.65 , which is the amount that was filed and remitted to the state of NC. Another cause of the difference here: Another cause of the difference is that TES Operating LLC's Florida filings are submitted quarterly. This means that the $314.20 in tax collected in FL would be remitted with the Q3 2025 filing, due in October, along with the tax collected in July and September. Within your Zamp account, the Tax Collected Report can be used to view tax collection across various date ranges, sources, and states, which shows $11,180.32 in tax, categorized as 'CSV', representing the Varago Sales Tax. The remaining NC and SC amounts total $3,189.66 in tax, which matches Shopify when filtering out Florida. One other small item to note is that there may be some variance in tax-due estimates from Zamp and Shopify due to time zone differences, timely filing discounts (such as those in Florida), and other factors mentioned in this article . I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions. Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

On September 9, 2025 we resolved this issue and completed a full data refresh to our Reporting system. Next Steps: No action is required from you to correct the report data. However, if you have used US sales tax reports from May 15, 2025 onwards for any tax filings or business decisions, consider consulting with a tax professional or accountant for any specific questions and next steps.

I've made a note about the timing of cleaning up transactions, and I'll mention this on our side so that we hold off on exporting and importing QuickBooks Online data until the 6th. It's helpful to know that you don't use QuickBooks Online for sales tax calculation and understanding that an order management platform is included in the mix and is the ""source of truth"" for these invoices, is also helpful. Our improved QuickBooks Online integration may still be able to be useful considering this situation, but those are discussions we'll visit in the future. Have a great weekend!

So typically transactions are not correct until after the first week of the following month. We also do not use QB for sales tax calculation.

We found that some QuickBooks Online transactions were missing one and a different tax amount in Zamp than it had in QuickBooks Online. We've adjusted for these situations, and now the tax-due estimate for Oklahoma is $1,576.80 . Do we have your approval to proceed with the filings this month? A quick update: We've also improved our import process for Billboards Etc QuickBooks Online data, and we'll move it to a manual method where we'll have the data in Zamp on or before the 5th of each month. Once it's out of Beta, we do have a recently released Zamp QuickBooks Online integration, which includes tax calculation capabilities; that integration would simplify the filing situation as well.

For Oklahoma, the difference is likely related to a differeing tax amount on an OK transaction within Zamp. They could have updated an invoice, and the QBO Alloy integration didn't catch it. https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2m36ur0020suqo016757tc/integrations/clvbecp540001opt2iakg8bj5 https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2m36ur0020suqo016757tc/transactions?date=2025-08-01~2025-09-12&limit=100&shipToState=OK The other possibility is that a transaction has a bad address or mismatching info as I see one transaction failed to calculate in the summary and is excluded: We'll hold their filings for now, as we'll need to investigate this further."

We've been investigating this and found that this address is showing up as an 'Unknown address' within our Address Validation service. This means that it is an address not present in the USPS address data, along with other address data we utilize. Using a separate address validation tool , I was able to confirm the above. When I enter the street number and name separately, the address below is displayed; however, it's marked as an invalid address within USPS data and our own records. 2071 Kimberton Rd, Phoenixville, PA 19460 That said, the above address will validate with Zamp's Address Validation API endpoint. In a situation like this, we recommend using an address nearby or asking the client for an address that is available to receive US Mail (as this should validate on our end). We also recommend ensuring that Zamp's address validation does not prevent invoices from being created and processed if the zip code is valid or the address is validated using an alternative method. While this isn't perfect, it would be a way to allow invoices/orders to proceed. Addresses that don't validate with our endpoint should be rare, but we occasionally encounter them from time to time. Zamp is currently exploring various ways to improve the handling of addresses in these situations, and I'll be sure to bring this scenario to the attention of our product and engineering teams.

3069907321,185547,9423920917,note,2025-09-30T18:21:44Z,chris@zamp.com,"We also decided (with the customer stating they wished this) to recalculate all June 2025 through September 2025 NY transaction line items containing kits or accessories, as those should have been taxed in Shopify. The file I've attached below is the recalc file, which is specific to NY. Important : the customer gave approval to file to the summary (tax due) for NY Q4 2024 and NY Q1 2025 - they're paying out of pocket. From the call, they believe they've categorized products correctly in Shopify, based on my/Ashley's thoughts, and are waiting for more details from tax research. We may need to recalculate the tax for other states or sales based on the results of tax research. Lastly, we discussed how to configure tax-exempt customers in Shopify for their wholesale store properly. —— For next week (tracked separately in BC), TS or AM will need to review tax collection: check on their whisk and kit products to see if tax is collected in Shopify. ——"

This past week, the Zamp Team attended our annual in-person off-site, and our response times were delayed. After reviewing New York, we've confirmed that we can recalculate the tax that should have been collected in New York for the New York fiscal quarters (Q4 2024 and Q1 2025). From what we've been able to review on the NY Transactions, I do not see any tax collection from Shopify for the kits and accessories (a Bamboo Whisk and a bottle on the wholesale site). With our current level of access in Shopify, I'm unsure if this is occurring because the 'Charge taxes on this product' box is unchecked on the product(s). I'm also going to review the other Shopify stores in more detail, as I noticed one or some are related to B2B/Wholesale transactions; we'll likely want to exclude those here. Would you like to schedule a call to discuss this and the best path forward, or would email be better for you? For now, I will work on recalculating only the kit and accessory items on your Shopify NY Transactions from December 1, 2024, to May 31, 2025 (NY Q4 2024 through Q1 2025). Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

Regarding the tax collected for Colorado: We show a total tax collected amount of $11,934.19 in CO. The $221.71 difference is due to what we call a timely filing discount in CO, and the CO Department of Revenue calls this a ""Service Fee"".

Regarding Georgia: The difference here is due to a timely filing discount in GA called ' Vendor's Compensation ', which is already accounted for within our tax-due estimate. The Vendor's Compensation amount for Georgia in August 2025 is $46.65 , and the original tax total is $1,554.94 . Regarding Illinois: The difference here is also related to a timely filing discount in IL called "" Retailer's Discount "", and that amount is $37.00 .

A couple of quick questions: Do we know the zip code for the Apex Human Performance invoice (HS-1032)? Do we know the zip code for the Rippling - Gabriel Ginorio invoice (HS-1025)? Without at least the city and state, or zip code, we would be unable to import the invoice into Zamp, as we use the address data to ensure proper state/jurisdiction reporting. Hopefully, the sales folks provide the addresses or zip codes for the two missing. Otherwise, we can include those in filings for October that are processed in November 2025. Have a great weekend!

Big learning curve here for me. :) I've entered any invoices created before the sync as sales receipts, and attached a report here. Does this work for September? These invoices are all for service or design, so none of these sales included sales tax. Although if you need more information let me know. I'm still waiting for a response from two salespeople if they have addresses for the two missing."

We (Zamp) were at a company-wide annual offsite for most of this week, and our responses have been delayed more than ususal. 1) Noted and understood. We'll make sure that this is reported. 2) OK, this makes sense, and it may have been a miscommunication or something missed on our side; thanks for your understanding here. I vaguely recall this conversation, but I may be confusing it with discussions with other clients we work with. I've put multiple notes, reminders, and ""triggers"" of sorts into our monthly data process to ensure we wait to import Handwrytten's data until the 6th of each month. We won't need anything else to make this happen, as it's a process item on our end. I appreciate the offer! 3) Regarding Hubspot: This makes sense considering that the invoices have already been paid via HubSpot. Our current process for importing a custom invoice-list-based report wouldn't capture this. But maybe you or we can create a sales receipt report that we'll also import? We usually use this custom Zamp Sales Tax Report , and could include the 'sales receipt' record type. I just want to ensure it's accurate and does not include non-HubSpot data we'd like to avoid importing. I didn't see any sales receipts in QBO currently, and am just being extra cautious here. Does the data appear more reliable (including proper amounts, addresses, dates, etc.) within Hubspot or within QuickBooks Online? What would be the most efficient path forward for you in this situation? Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

These are always entered on the 1st but sometimes carry over a few days, or if the 1st is on a Saturday or Holiday, it may carry a few days late. I thought we had already discussed waiting until around the 5th of the month, but I could be having déjà vu. I would say that we definitely need to implement that delay in Zamp reporting, or our manual invoices from those clients will continue to be missed. Let me know if you need anything else from me to make that happen! Backtracking on the HubSpot question, we are most likely going to enter HubSpot transactions as sales receipts after they've been paid through HubSpot, rather than invoices in QBO to avoid the issue we keep having with paying tax on unpaid invoices, or sales reps mis-recording or lacking billing data. Do you see any issues with implementing the connection this way? Will Zamp still be able to pull that from QBO or should I just plan to share the HubSpot report with Zamp each month? Thank you again for all your help. -Allie"
3066813939,183878,9383398509,message,2025-09-19T19:37:43Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Allie, Thanks for the response here! So, ultimately we need to connect Hubspot invoicing to QBO in order for Zamp to report invoiced sales? Correct! This is likely the simplest or path of least resistance, but HubSpot's QuickBooks Online integration is one that I don't yet know much about, although it appears to be a well-built integration. The other option here would be for someone outside of Zamp to build a custom integration (with our API) between HubSpot and Zamp. Regarding #2 and #3 —you're right, and thanks for catching that! I was clearly writing too quickly. The only question left there would be why Zamp didn't pull that one invoice and I will include it manually in our monthly csv for September if you are unable to find record of it. (I wasn't able to find it searching for 2025 transactions in the Zamp portal). After reviewing the transactions in Zamp, the timestamps in our database, and the QuickBooks Online Audit History for invoice 9979, I'm not entirely sure what caused this issue. That said, my running theory is that although I exported Handwrytten's QuickBooks Online data on August 1, 2025, it may have been before the invoice was added at around 2:40 PM EDT. I can import a CSV file to account for this invoice (9979) using the invoice details in QuickBooks Online, as shown here . This way, we can keep track of this and keep one more thing off your plate. :) Questions: 1) Is invoice 9979 up to date, or are any changes needed to be made? 2) When are your or others' changes to invoices within QuickBooks Online typically complete? We could add a note to our process to remind us to wait until the 5th or 6th (at the latest) each month to import Handwrytten's QuickBooks Online invoices. In the past, we typically didn't reach the point of importing this invoice data until the 5th or later in the month. However, we've implemented several process improvements over the last approximately two months, which have led to this typically happening on the 1st-3rd of each month, unless otherwise noted. Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a great weekend! Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

We are switching our CRM platform from Pipedrive to HubSpot. We are beginning to send invoices through HubSpot and still will be sending invoices through QBO as well (currently still have QBO linked to Pipedrive only as we are all learning HubSpot). We had a minor issue come up with sales tax on one invoice and that led to some questions. 1) Does Zamp integrate with HubSpot? 2) We recreated a HubSpot invoice from one that existed in QBO already (9979 dated 7/31) - I thought this would cause an issue with us having filed tax on the invoice already, but we haven't. Any idea why this transaction was skipped in our integration? It works out in this case but just curious. The invoice wasn't paid through QBO yet but per our previous discussion sales tax was being reported on accrual basis, when the invoice is opened, not paid. 3) The new HubSpot invoice was paid today, but we forgot to include sales tax on the invoice. It looks like we should be able to void the original QBO invoice 9979 without reporting it to Zamp since it wasn't included previously? Then we can create another HubSpot invoice to charge the sales tax only? As always, thank you for your help!

I've imported all of the partial refunds (late discounts), created adjustments for the issue where Shopify shouldn't have charged tax, and ensured the GMA transactions were properly accounted for. While reviewing the ReturnGo transactions (one by one, in Zamp + Shopify), I realized that we wouldn't need to make any adjustments because Zamp has the original (unchanged) transaction with tax broken out separately, and any refunds associated with returns were also properly accounted for. I'm happy to show you how we sorted this out; if you'd like to h op on a call sometime , I'd be glad to do so. This is similar to how Zamp works with Loop transactions, although it's trickier to tie together because the ReturnGo exchange and return transactions each have an ID separate from the original order; there wasn't an ID tying them all together.

I'm reviewing the transactions and there are a few non-taxable transactions that Shopify collected tax on. I am refunding the sales tax on my side. How will you adjust from taxable to non-taxable? In these scenarios, we would need to create a couple of transactions to fully account for this change and create a clear accounting line of separation: A complete and separate transaction, which is a refund of the entire order's amount (including tax). A separate order transaction without tax and likely a 'Purpose' value of 'RESALE' if the transaction was a resale/wholesale transaction, otherwise we also have the supported tax-exemption reasons noted in this article . As long as we know the Order IDs associated with this situation, we can make an exception to create the transactions on our end. In the future, it would be helpful to have these details in a CSV file. We share how to mark customers as tax-exempt within Shopify so that Zamp automatically recognizes this in this article. This helps for future Shopify orders or scenarios where you know ahead of time that the customer is tax-exempt. Regarding the CSV files: We'll work on importing the GMA Transactions today.

I've attached the supporting exports and working files for the filing this month; I ensured we kept the partially refunded adjustments in place. The amounts align closely, except for in the states noted below, and that reason is primarily due to refunds from previous periods causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions.

You will note in file that the first 3 columns are identical to the figures in the snippet below. The figures in your file are slightly different from what is on the website. Do you know why this would be? In the file that you labeled Prev, you state that we are not registered in Alabama however the Zamp website shows that sales tax was collected in that state, also noted in the snippet below. Also, from what was collected versus what was remitted, I show that a balance is due for Colorado of $1,700 which can't be due to discount so this seems like an area that needs to be investigated further.

After reviewing the data further and revisiting this situation, I agree that the issue here is related to QuickBooks Online invoices being voided, modified, or having their addresses updated; it may also be related to missing Credit Memos. Next steps and questions: 1) Could you or your team provide us with an invoice list export from QuickBooks Online containing the data noted below for the date range of 6/1/24 through 8/31/24? Most importantly, the period from 8/1/25 to 8/31/25 is crucial, as it allows us to ensure that Micromart's filings are progressing smoothly this month. The invoice details we would need: Date Num Amount Tax (or Tax Amount) Ship To 2) Would you or your team be able to and comfortable with providing us with accountant access to Micromart's QuickBooks Online environment so that, in the interim, we can manually obtain the invoice data and better ensure the changes you've noted are captured in the future? Important: Please note that we're currently holding Micromart's filings while we investigate this situation and verify their accuracy. We will need to ensure that the filings are processed soon, preferably by tomorrow (9/17/25), to facilitate timely filings. I want you to know that I aim to help resolve this situation, find a path forward for future filings, and ensure we find a way to reconcile any past differences. We're also happy to discuss this on a call, which can be scheduled using this link ."

What you're sharing here makes sense to me, and some of these reasons are likely the root causes. We'll look into it as soon as possible and follow up with an action plan. For now, I've attached an export of all of the transaction data within Zamp for Micromart. The situation here could be resolved in the future with our recently improved and released QuickBooks Online integration. Someone from Zamp will reach out about this separately."
3061786871,182233,9323131936,customer,2025-09-04T20:25:47Z,thomas@micromart.com,"Hi,

Thank you for replying so quickly.

We have located the most likely source of 90% of the problem, it's to do with the initial QBO shipping addresses not filled with deposit invoices and we are working on addressing it internally first.
And I think it's also meaningful for ZAMP to look at the problem when QBO's invoices are voided/modified/address updated, our investigation shows those are not picked up and updated on ZAMP.

But in the meantime, we would like to review and potentially revise our state taxes filings from prior periods and for August.

Currently, there isn't a function in ZAMP to manually adjust the taxes being filed?

Would you please send me the ZAMP's sales taxes data stating the following? (from the beginning of time to Aug 31, 2025) Date Transaction invoice number Transaction invoice amount Tax amount State I have attached the comparison file put together by our team for the sampled period.

Thank you,"

This is interesting to hear, and we'll definitely help sort out the cause of this difference. For now, and until this is sorted out, we're holding Micromart's sales tax filings for August 2025, which are due this month. We'll keep a close eye on the state filing deadlines and work together to ensure this is resolved on time. To schedule a call, please use this link , and if the available times won't work for you (or your team), please share dates and times that will work for you. A quick question: When you or your team have a moment, could you please add Zamp ( integrations@zamp.com ) as an accountant user within your QuickBooks Online account so that we can export data for our review? If you prefer not to do this, please share an 'Invoice List' export from QuickBooks Online with the additional columns and invoice data.

This is why on the Zamp platform, they were unable to pick up the transactions on their system.

3060375737,181340,9322059823,note,2025-09-04T17:35:49Z,chris@zamp.com,"Notes: Gemini notes are here for John and me. Important: We found that tax calcs in WooCommerce were using WooCommerce's standard rate tables with mostly state rates listed. This resulted in tax calculations in FL, where they shouldn't have been collecting. We disabled all standard rates and enabled Zamp tax calculations, while also ensuring their correct nexus states were listed. —- They use MyWorks to sync Woo orders to QBO. All of their orders come from WooCommerce, and QBO is just used to generate revenue/sales summaries, and they're starting to use QBO to balance/reconcile sales tax (but their process isn't super detailed.) Currently, Sandy has to manually edit QBO orders to fix the tax because QBO calculates only state-level taxes (or something) while Woo calculates more. Eventually, Sandy wants to avoid having to adjust QBO manually. We'll need to figure out: If they should sync directly from WooCommerce or QuickBooks Online. If they're a good fit for our QBO integration (might not be a path, considering ERP pricing.) They want to use the liability report, but it doesn't account for annual/semi-annual/quarterly state tax due/filed amounts if the filing period is still in progress (or not ""over""). For now, they'll use the filing page in Zamp until improvements come to the liability report. The liability report is expected to be improved (through this initiative ) before Sandy needs to reconcile sales tax/accounts again. Also related: https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/41295310/card_tables/cards/8960393548 NSAF follows a fiscal year, which spans from April to March, and this is when they need to reconcile taxes and ensure the books in QBO match. Next steps: 1) Delete QBO Transactions from the Alloy sync. 2) Sync transactions manually via CSV. 3) Send Sandy an updated estimate. 4) Check with Matt G, Carie, and Ashley about possible new QBO integration usage for NSCAF."

After further investigation, we identified the cause of the missing Ketchum, ID Jurisdiction. Our engineering team let me know that we currently expect a 6% rate to be returned for all orders within Idaho because Zamp does not yet support the local city tax rates (sometimes called ""home rule"" cities), as we're currently unable to support filing in those cities due to the nature of the individual registration and filing. This means Zamp does not currently support local sales tax scenarios in Idaho. This is something that is on Zamp's radar to support. Next steps: Our recommendation here would be to hard-code the local city tax option for the Idaho cities listed here , along with the corresponding tax rate. If you'd like to take this path, please let us know. We can help you find these local ID city tax rates if you'd like. Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

Therefore, the application of the 6% state sales tax rate on the order shipped to Ketchum, Idaho, was accurate. No further action or changes are necessary at this time.

We have been collecting sales tax since March, for a total liability of approx. $21.8K. Per our dashboard, Zamp is showing $22K collected in August, but in this email we're only filing $4,314.97, (which aligns with what we show collected for August).

Let's tackle each of the variances here, and we'll ensure we're all on the same page. MA: the variance seems to be HOS4524727618 where Shopify reflects this as NY vs Zamp reflected it as MA. This variance is expected due to a known limitation in Shopify's tax calculations and reporting (it can also be expected depending on when the address was changed) when an address is changed on an order. Here, the tax amount and jurisdiction are not updated, and this is likely due to the payment already being processed at this point. Reviewing HOS4524727618 in Shopify, I can see that the address was changed on 9/2/25: Question —Would you like us to change this transaction in Zamp back to the NY address or leave it as MA? Typically, we recommend leaving the address as the updated address, since that's technically the correct shipping location; however, the tax collected may be slightly too high or low for the updated address. NY: Shopify for the quarter totals 19,451.62 which is a 31.11 difference now. Part of it being the line above. I am curious why we do not see the $200 discount in Zamp's figure. For New York, the difference is likely due to time zone differences (Zamp files in EST, while Shopify reports in PST for House of Spoils), and possibly a bit of sales tax rounding. We provide more details about the causes of these minor differences (less than 1%) in this article. The difference for NY shouldn't be related to a discount here. The $200 difference was initially caused by our system not yet incorporating the ~$200 in adjustments made, and I sent the tax-due estimate (and updates) too quickly. In Zamp, we see a tax collected amount of $19,483.06 : Our tax-due estimate and the Zamp Liability Report now show a similar amount, $19,482.73, for NY Q2 2025: We're certainly happy to dig into this further and trace the exact root cause, and at this point, we'll need to know if we can proceed with filings or not to ensure timely filing (NY and other states are due by 9/19-9/20). If we find that the root cause of the difference for NY is not what I suspect (time zones or rounding), we can help correct for it in the subsequent filing as well. I hope this is helpful!

Here are some notes about the differences noted, and they correlate with the screenshot I've shared below: Colorado - this difference was partly related to a timely filing discount ( 24.69 ) and various amounts within Zamp that had not yet been updated. CO's tax-due estimate is $ 1,231.05 after the discounts. Georgia - This difference is related to a discount ($9.99) and to the $14.99 manual CSV adjustment made for 7321586597950 , as shown in yellow below. The tax-due estimate we have now is: $ 322.88 Massachusetts - On our end, within both the Tax Liability Report and Tax Collected Report , I don't see a difference, as they both show an amount of $595.02 . New York - The difference here is related to the two transactions highlighted in green, below, where we needed to ensure tax was refunded that was not yet captured from Shopify (likely due to order edits). These transactions are: HOS4524714718-order-edit-adj - $131.80 in tax refunded. HOS4524713618-order-edit-adj - $68.00 in tax refunded. The NY tax-due estimate we see is: $19,482.73 .

Can you confirm the process for future nexus thresholds / states taxes? For NY/NJ I added the states in the BC app settings, are there any additional steps we need to take? The process is that future states need to be added in the BC app and within Zamp (we have some internal configuration to do for these). Typically, the configuration within Zamp is set up ahead of time, and this was more of a timing/time-zone-difference/US-Holiday-related mix-up. We'll improve the handling of these situations! :) Regarding MA, IL, and WA: These three states are configured and set up within Zamp to begin calculations on October 1, 2025, which will allow your configuration in the BC app to initiate tax calculations once enabled. Meaning, a similar scenario won't happen with these states now that we're all on the same page. I hope this helps!"

This is still on our radar for investigation, and we've started an initial comparison between Zamp and Shopify. We hope to share more details within a few days. Please note that, based on our experience and research, Shopify's United States Sales Tax Report (this version, linked here , is filtered to states being filed this month) tends to align more closely with Zamp when considering the items highlighted in this article. This is partly because sales tax in the US is typically bucketed based on the shipping region (Ship To) rather than the Shopify Billing region. Zamp's Transactions page, filings, and various reports automatically adjust for each state's specific time zone when accounting for the transaction date, whereas Shopify utilizes a single time zone. I'm still noticing a slight difference, and we're working to determine the root cause. We'll follow up as soon as we can!"

I've manually created this North Carolina invoice (ID: 1725) within Zamp, and now, your tax-due estimate for NC is: $2,263.65 Do we have your approval to proceed with Spotlight Solar's filings this month? Regarding next steps and your question: How can we make sure the Zamp system finds these in QBO without assistance? This is a great question! For now, we could do this by taking either path noted here: Ensure all QuickBooks Online invoices have a valid (and complete) ship to address and the amounts are correct (including tax) when saved. Typically, a missing address will prevent an invoice from syncing here. Grant Zamp (integrations@zamp.com) access to your QuickBooks Online account as an accountant user , and we can then build and export a custom report to compare against Zamp. We can also manually import any changes. We may also have some exciting updates coming about our new and improved QuickBooks Online integration, as we're currently testing it with a small group of clients. Please let us know if you have any questions! Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

Yes, we can re-export SIGMA Equipment's QuickBooks Online data tomorrow (September 4, 2025) to ensure that any edits or changes are captured. Zamp typically needs to receive approval by the 3rd of each month, but our processes have been improving, and we're working more efficiently than in the past. We aim to have data imported as early as possible each month to ensure more time for review and efficiency for our filing team (more time to file returns for all clients we work with). This means we typically import data on the 1st and 2nd, and send tax-due estimates on those days. That said, we'll add some notes to wait until the 3rd of each month to import data from QuickBooks Online, as we can be flexible in this regard. We'll have a new tax-due estimate heading your way by tomorrow afternoon."

I've long had a suspicion that there is a delay between Shopify's reporting (especially the tax-related reports) and actual orders. Still, I've been unable to find exact proof of this. My guess here is that in this situation, the differences previously seen may have just been to delays and timing issues (utilizing different time zones.) Usually, variances between Shopify and Zamp's reporting of 2% or less are due to time zone differences. We appreciate you approving the filings! Regarding Shopify access: Thanks for the collaborator code! I've requested access with the minimum permissions necessary for Zamp to assist in review situations like this thoroughly, and for us to continue providing our fully managed service (e.g., reviewing tax settings, installing the Zamp Shopify app/connection, etc.).

I've been looking into this further, and I don't yet know the root cause of the difference, as it doesn't appear to be related to a timezone difference or other common reasons noted in this article . Please note that Zamp's tax-due estimate should cover the period from August 1, 2025, to August 31, 2025, as the New York Department of Revenue has assigned Tocco Leggero a Quarterly Prepay filing frequency, and Zamp makes prepayments in the months when a return is not filed. Our estimate accounts for the following total tax in NY and prepayments: Total Tax Due Estimate for Q2 2025 (6/1/25-8/31/25): $26,491.97 . Prepayment 1 - July 2025: $7,511.24 . Prepayment 2 - August 2025: $9,002.19 . Remaining tax estimated due: $9,978.54 . A few questions: 1) When you have a moment, could you please share a screenshot or export of the report that you're using to compare within Shopify? This is helpful to ensure we're all on the same page, and can help confirm if the report in question includes Point of Sale Transactions (as some do not). 2) Could you also please provide the Tocco Leggero (Luke's) Shopify store Collaborator access code to us? This will enable us to regain access to our expired login and review and troubleshoot further. Shopify expires this access after a specific period, and we occasionally need to request it again. This is separate from our integration and the automatic sync of Shopify sales data. 3) Do you know if anyone on the Tocco Leggero Team manually edits Shopify orders or uses a third-party app to do that? This involves making changes such as adding or removing items from an order, issuing order-level partial refunds, or adjusting amounts on the order, among other actions."

Part of this data includes address information from the United States Postal Service (USPS), which considers this address invalid.

We have installed the plugin and configured it as given in the knowledgebase link you shared. For some reason we don't have sales tax component displayed on the checkout page. Plus we have few questions. 1) We only get TAX code input field at variation level for variable product. At parent level we only see dropdown field so it does not allow us to set the tax code at parent level. 2) We are trying to set the Tax code at the variant level but they are not being saved for some reason. Are there any validations which needs to be meet like code must be configured at parent level before being applied to variant. 3) Even though we add valid shipping address, it shows Invalid Shipping Address. Pls check below screenshots. 4) kent@lighthouseaccountants.com I need a list of TAX code for each product. I believe they will be same for their variants too. Plus I need a list of NEXUS states too if you can provide. Thanks Saumil Shah"

Thank you for the update around point number 1. Regarding the other topics I can update as well. The address validation hook is optimized on SBX https://pronto-marketing.sbx.keylight.com/configuration/hooks/ag8mlu8m5h16jgzqzp1a8usf/actions/60kzw6yusenfp1h9bl2o2x4b
It does exclude addresses outside the US in order to not validate them for Zamp. In addition the script fills up the zero's in order to make the Zip consistent.

If we now look at the hook code, you will see starting from line 64 three options configured:
Lines 64 - 73, this function just throws the error, also per default
Lines 75 - 88, contains a function that could push a status to a custom field that could be created and added into the code.
Lines 90 - 100, here is a similar functionality but this could be used to tag the account with a tag accordingly if the validation failed.

These three methods could also be combined. If you now just take this hook code to production, it would perform the first option, showing a generic error.

You could use this as a basis now to be tested and implemented further for prod.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Erik

Hi Erik,

I have a few updates and follow-ups we'd like to discuss with you: 1. Bad Debt & Commission Products: After internal discussion, we've decided to add the R_SRV code to both commission and bad-debt products, and we'll also change how we handle bad-debt orders. So for now, we can hold off on making any API change to stop these products from pushing to Zamp. 2. Address Validation Hook & Integration: I pushed this to production earlier this week. However, a new client attempting to sign up couldn't save their billing address, as the Client Portal returned a ""Something Went Wrong"" error. Disabling the Hook and Integration resolved it. The client's address is in the UK. Could you advise how we can re-enable this integration while ensuring clients are able to save their addresses without encountering errors? Integration: Zamp (Validate Address) Hook: Verify with ZAMP 3. Invalid Zip Codes (Zamp requires 5-digit zip codes): Do you have any updates on the configuration your team have been working on to ensure Keylight adds leading zeros to ZIP codes?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

This removes them from any reporting and economic nexus analysis; it also prevents the transactions from being recreated later. These were the transactions in the ' 1.

To ensure commission expenses and bad debt are properly excluded from sales tax reporting, do you have any suggestions on how we can implement this within the API integration? We would recommend consulting with the Keylight Team to figure out the best path forward, since this will depend on configuration, customization, or other factors within Keylight's system. For example, is there a specific tax code, hook, or API condition we can use to exclude these types of transactions from being synced to Zamp? Zamp does not have tax codes for commission expenses or bad debt because these are not sales, orders, or transactions involving the sale of a service or product to a customer. From Zamp's perspective, we recommend excluding these transactions in a way that prevents them from syncing. If Keylight has different record types that can be used, we recommend using one that can be configured not to sync with Zamp. I hope this helps!"

In other words, the tax collection is associated with Q3 2025 (July 1, 2025-September 30, 2025). We'll make sure that those are remitted to the state for you this month. The dates are in column H (transaction_date) and I (tax_date) of the SOC report. The attached CSV file, from Q2 2025, shows no tax collected in Texas. Have a wonderful weekend!

I'm fairly certain that they aren't collecting in your listed states because they don't have sales tax configured correctly in Stripe. I have a call scheduled to go over her settings in Stripe on Monday at which point we can get them all set!
3052504035,179640,9345342955,message,2025-09-10T16:06:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Zoya, Thanks for your patience with this. 1) Regarding your first question: Why did we file $0 returns then? We looked into this further and found that the reason $0 filings for August 2025 are set to be processed for Science on Call in New York and Virginia is that your products (Technical Support Services) are tax-exempt in these two states. Additionally, it appears that the tax collection you're seeing (nearly $8,000) was collected in Texas and Nebraska. All of Science on Call's other state sales tax registrations are assigned Quarterly or Annual filing frequencies. In other words, most of those states won't have a filing due until October 2025 (for Q3 2025) or January 2026 (for 2025). The Quarterly states, such as FL, CA, NC, VT, IL, and NY, where Zamp has filed so far, did not have any tax collection in Stripe. Texas has a quarterly filing frequency. Nebraska has an annual filing frequency. Important note —we're investigating what happened with Science on Call's Q2 2025 Texas filing. The sales tax collection we're seeing within Stripe and your Zamp account is primarily within Texas and Nebraska: The above screenshot is a pivot table created from the Stripe Sales Tax Report that you shared, and this is close to what we see in Zamp on your Taxes Collected Report as well. Here's the total I see on your Zamp Transactions page: 2) Regarding your 2nd question: Aren't you using Stripe as your source of truth? Yes—Zamp uses Stripe as our source of truth by using Stripe's APIs and system to sync transaction data over to Zamp. Meaning, Zamp builds its own reports and transaction records based on details automatically synced from Stripe. 3) Regarding your third question: Are we sitting on $8K of Sales Taxes that need to be returned to customers? No—to our understanding and review, the tax that has been collected will be remitted. I'm investigating a few items regarding Texas, and we may need to escalate this to our Engineering Team for further review. A quick question for this month's filings: Do we have your approval to proceed with Science On Call's NY and VA filings, which are due this month?"

The issue we're seeing: Discounts are being applied at the item and order levels on WooCommerce orders once they are synced to Zamp, resulting in a discrepancy of $18.80; essentially, an extra item-level discount is being applied in Zamp. The shipping and tax amounts are correct. Within WooCommerce: An order is placed with a coupon that appears to offer a $92.20 discount at the order (header) level. The discount appears to be applied at the item level, and the total after discount is $77. The coupon is noted at the order level for $92.20. The order total is $93.73. Within Zamp: The order shows a unit price of $188.00 The unit discount is $18.80. The order-level discount is $92.20. The Order total is $112.53.

3049202315,178525,9285709461,customer,2025-08-27T02:28:58Z,amit@multisoft.com,"Hello, In the case of Colorado (and some other states), if deliveries are made by motor vehicle to a Colarado address when the transaction includes at least one taxable item then you need to collect Colorado's Retail Delivery Fee (RDF) of $0.28 per retail delivery. Retailers with less than $500,000 in Colorado sales during the previous year are exempt. Deliveries where all items are exempt from Colorado sales tax are not subject to the RDF. Colorado law mandates that the Retail Delivery Fee must be shown separately on the invoice or receipt, labeled specifically as ""retail delivery fees"", and distinctly separated from the price of items and any sales tax or other charges Currently on Shopify, for example, they combine it in the tax total though the reports shows it separated. Etsy shows it separately on invoices. So its clear that proper support is not consistent across all platforms yet but was required as of July 1, 2025. So in essence an additional tax for delivering anything taxable in Colorado. Does Zamp account for this in any way?

A quick question to ensure we're on the same page—is the delivery fee for this tangible product the same as shipping or handling? If so, we recommend using the line item associated with this delivery fee as the shippingHandling value sent to Zamp for calculations or transaction creation, instead of a separate line item. This can be seen on our transaction object documentation here . Zamp's API and overall system are designed to either treat shipping as taxable or tax-exempt, depending on state rules, and this is done in a manner entirely separate from a transaction's line items. Which also means that Zamp does not have a tax code specifically for delivery, shipping, or handling. If you're referring to something separate from shipping or handling, please let us know, and we can explore other options."

So I am clear, if i go to the advanced pricing and select tax free and enter this code R_SRV_ADMISSION that product will be tax free? In many states, yes, the R_SRV_ADMISSION tax code for the product would cause the product to be considered tax-exempt by Zamp's API. That said, our Tax Research Team's current research and taxability determination for this code and admissions within New York would treat this product as taxable (not tax-free). We can discuss this further during our call today, but if you are aware from your own research that these products (registration/admission) should be tax-exempt in NY, the tax code R_TPP_GIFT-CARD could be used as a workaround, as it is tax-exempt in all states."

We have an item that we want exempt from sales taxes, and although we set it up that way in bigccommerce, ZAMP is overriding it and adding tax, how do we exempt those sku's Ashley and I discussed this situation a bit earlier, and we also received the outreach through one of our contact forms. A product in BigCommerce can be exempted from tax by assigning a Zamp Tax Code from this list to a product in the section shown below: We share some details about this in our article here . The product setting can be found under BigCommerce Admin —> All Products —> the specific product —> Pricing —> Advanced Pricing —> Tax Provider Tax Code . A couple of quick questions: 1) To help us better offer suggestions or guidance, what is the specific product involved here, and how/why is it exempt? 2) If a tax code is already assigned, could you please let us know the specific product, tax code, or an example Order ID so that we can review it further? We can help see if we have a tax code that fits here, or recommend an alternative that would achieve your expected taxability results. We're also happy to schedule a call if that would be helpful!"

After further investigation, I've confirmed the details below, and the good news is that we're still seeing sales tax calculations occur as of today (8/19/25). Transactions were successfully created within Zamp (using our /transactions API endpoint) from Keylight until August 11, 2025. There are very few errors when creating transactions between 8/6/25 and 8/11/25; it has decreased since 8/5/25. A log export from our side is attached, showing these errors. The majority of these errors are related to missing required details, such as a Ship To Zip Code, or invalid zip codes. I found logs of calculation requests sent to Zamp from Pronto Marketing for today, with the latest log creation at August 19, 2025, 10:25 AM GMT. The above means that calculations are working, but for some reason (possibly something within Keylight's system), transaction creation (successful or attempted) has not happened since 8/11/25. Please let us know if you have any questions. I will be following up on our other email threads today, and we look forward to speaking with you tomorrow morning (8/20)."

Our Filing Team confirmed for me that we would still need to know the Colorado RDF amount for July 2025 to ensure an accurate sales tax filing for you. Could you share this amount as soon as you can? Once this is shared, we can process the filing."

It's good to know that the CO RDF payment has already been made, although my understanding is that our Filing Team would still need to know this amount to exclude it from the filings. When you have a moment, could you please share the CO RDF amount? Could you please confirm whether the filing has been completed or if there’s any delay we should be aware of? The filing has not yet been completed, and our team was about to complete it yesterday when they realized we needed to confirm the CO RDF amount. This filing should be submitted today, once the above is sorted out. In the future, the filing should generally be submitted earlier in the month, with various process improvements we've put in place. Thanks for your patience and partnership here!"

I agree with the approach for the period of 6/1/25-7/29/25 of manually comparing ZAMP vs. BC and manually adjusting and then double check the sync completeness in August.

I'm still combing through those logs, and I will be sharing the timeouts and 5** server error situations with our Integration Team, as I believe those warrant additional investigation. Regarding the missing transactions: I finally remembered to look at the various BigCommerce system logs, and found my way to the ""Staff Action Log"" area and noticed the below setting being enabled: It looks like this change was made by me (reviewing the IP address, which is blurred out above), but I did not have any notes about this on my end. Usually, I'll make a note and share the finding/update with you. We will do better about this in the future. We also found some documentation improvements that will help catch this better in the future. What this means: To me, this means that the transaction sync (order commit) to Zamp likely wasn't enabled before 7/29/25, and the orders/refunds/adjustments that were synced before that date, probably had a payment change or something, that triggered the sync with Zamp. I couldn't find an example of that setting being enabled or disabled before 7/29: Next step questions: 1) Does the above make sense to both of you? 2) Jessica—are you OK with taking the approach noted below? We'll handle these steps. Export all data in BigCommerce (for all states) that covers the date range of 6/1/25-7/29/25. Exporting the same date range from Zamp. Compare the transactions for any missing items. Import the missing transactions into the August 2025 filing period via a manual CSV file. I would be able to have this done by EOD my Monday (8/25/25) if not earlier in the day."

We have certain required endpoints put in place and registered that BigCommerce then hits when they need to calculate, commit, adjust or void a transaction. I'm noticing the database on our end contains order transactions from 7/28/2025 and on to even today, but none from before that. The Zamp Tax Integration toggle that says ""Send your transaction reports to Zamp"" needs to be toggled on in order for the orders to be reported to Zamp and in order to have the transaction information saved to our transaction table. The setting in the Tax Provider section is BigCommerce related we don't control that. I did see some orders in August that were sending from Texas to other states such as New York that are not part of their Taxable States. These states won't even calculate tax unless they are included in the Taxable States array In response to someone toggling sync/provider reporting buttons on/off: It does sound like a possibility Chris. And here is the response from BigCommerce on that endpoint { ""data"": { ""tax_entered_with_prices"": false, ""price_display_settings"": { ""show_inclusive_in_control_panel"": false, ""control_panel_price_display_strategy"": ""EXCLUSIVE"", ""invoice_price_display_strategy"": ""ZONE"" }, ""fallback_strategy"": ""BASIC"", ""should_subtract_store_tax"": false, ""should_use_geolocation_to_determine_guest_shopper_tax_zone"": false, ""guest_shopper_tax_zone_id"": 1, ""store_tax_zone_id"": 1, ""document_submission_strategy"": ""ON_PAYMENT_CAPTURE"", ""rounding_strategy"": ""RATE_RESULT_ROUNDING"" }, ""meta"": {} } From Brandon (Blayzer): I see no rules in our CloudFlare for Australia, but I've whitelisted it anyway"

Thanks for sending this over. Confirming that these have been signed and sent out (4 via the post office, 3 via email for which I've copied you in).

I started looking into the other states that can be closed out electronically. I've noticed that some of the information in the PDF is not accurate, for example for Florida. The link doesn't work. I'm not sure how to close this out. Can you take a look, please? I did manage to close out Connecticut, but nowhere did it say that it needed to be done directly by an owner / director of the business.

3039038476,175183,9450595445,message,2025-10-07T23:53:53Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Akikio, Thank you again for your patience and understanding. After running through various comparisons of transactions within Zamp and Shopify, we realized that Shopify's documentation about the ""United States Sales Tax report"" has a bullet point consideration noting only to use this report to see Shopify tax data after 7/1/2024: The above details led us to believe that Shopify's United States sales tax report is only accounting for taxes from 7/1/24-12/31/24 in this screenshot: The above total is $144,722.69 when combining the 'Total Item tax amount' and 'Total shipping tax amount', which is close to what we see in your Zamp Transactions page for 7/1/24-12/31/24: Zamp is within 2.8% of the Shopify tax amount for the same date range , at $148,764.44. Shopify's documentation directs us to use the Shopify 'Taxes' Report instead, and the Shopify Taxes Report for 2024 for ACDC Apparel shows a tax collected amount that aligns more closely with Zamp's amount: Shopify's 2024 Taxes Report shows a total of $230,000 in tax collected when filtering by 'US' as the tax country and a 'Not filed' filter for 'Filed by channel' (meaning Shopify, Amazon, or another marketplace remitted the tax on your behalf). Zamp's tax collected amount was $236,000 on your transactions page , and Zamp's filings for ACDC Apparel last year were less than that amount, likely related to timely filing discounts. The above details indicate that Zamp is very close to the tax amount listed in Shopify, within 2.6%. There are some common reasons (we've shared before) that can cause slight differences like this. This also means that we do not believe Zamp paid more in tax for ACDC Apparel than was collected. That said, please let us know if you have any questions. We're also happy to schedule a call if that would be preferred, and I can coordinate with Amelia to ensure we're all involved in the conversation. Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

Please note that the minor percentage differences under 5%  (e.g., CT, GA, or OK) appear to be related to expected (and normal) variances tied to time zone adjustments, rounding, etc. That said, we can adjust for these as we did last month, to ensure timely filing. Zamp is utilizing MST, EST, and CST time zones for all of the states involved, while Shopify utilizes a single time zone (likely PST as Vetchy is based in Los Angeles, CA) when reporting transaction and tax data. The states with larger differences are interesting, and we'll figure out the cause. Those states are AR, CO, GA, LA, and RI. Although I don't see any Shopify third-party apps in use that appear to be the root cause, this could happen if Shopify orders are edited directly within the Shopify Admin's view of an order. We've seen this happen with returns, exchanges, or one-off customer requests (e.g., retroactively applying a discount.) For this month, I'll start working on making these adjustments and follow up as soon as possible. Next steps, toward resolution: 1) Could we schedule a call with Ashley and me to discuss potential causes and items that relate to this scenario? Ideally, we would sort this out and ensure we agree on a month-to-month action plan before filings start in September 2025. If a time that works best for you isn't open on my schedule, please let me know, and I'll see what can be moved around. 2) When you or your team have a moment, could you please share your Shopify Collaborator Access Code with us?

We are liable only if we haven't already paid tax on this client's Quickbooks invoice in 2024 (before we discovered the duplicate issue). They are currently using credits to place bulk orders that they prepaid for in November 2024, Invoice 8879 (11/01/2024). If we did not file this one as tax-exempt, then the API transactions should be tax-exempt until their prepaid credits are depleted (assuming we filed the correct sales tax for November 2024). Looking at the transactions in the Zamp portal I believe that this was included in our Nov-2024 Colorado filing, so the API transactions should be voided from the July return. Thank you, Allie"

While preparing to file in Colorado, our filing team noticed a significant discrepancy between the tax amount collected and what Zamp would expect to file for CO. This difference is related to a large API (Website) transaction, and the ID for it is f0ceb5573174230a11fc24933e59e768b47d. Usually, larger transactions like this one are tied to QuickBooks Online, as the API transactions tend to be for smaller amounts. This is what we see for this transaction: Questions: 1) Should we delete this transaction if it should not have been created within Zamp? 2) Or should this transaction be treated as fully tax-exempt? We're attempting to determine if this transaction should have had tax collected. Unfortunately, it's tricky to decide on the intent based on the information and API logs we have. I'm available after 3 PM EST to hop on a quick call, and I can also be reached directly at 513-504-1463."

Just so you know, this includes the adjustments made for duplicate tax paid, and I've attached a file showing those adjustments for this month (and previous months). We've also adjusted for the voided invoices Allie shared, which are 9896 9929 The adjustment for voided invoice 9007 (in MN) should be accounted for in the Q3 2025 MN filing processed in October, and we'll continue tracking this. Typically, we would have this tax-due estimate over to you a lot earlier. This month and last month have been unexpected. We have implemented many improvements to prevent this, and part of that is that the Technical Success Team has grown. Meaning, in the future, we shouldn't be sharing this so close to the state filing deadlines. The above also means that although we know it's the afternoon (EST) on a Friday, we need to be aware of any questions and have approval to file by the end of the day today ( 8/15/25 ) to ensure timely filing in states with deadlines of 8/20/25. I'm available the rest of the day to hop on a quick call, and I can also be reached directly at 513-504-1463. Please let me know if you have any questions.

We reviewed the tax-due estimate and found that it aligns with the amounts Belva already shared with us. A few items to note alongside the amounts shared with us: Louisiana $483.10 - the $0.01 difference is related to state-specific rounding. Ohio $0 - Ohio is a state that is filed twice per year (semi-annually); it's due to be filed in January 2026. South Carolina $2,116.00 - Zamp's initial tax-due estimate matches this amount, but it is lowered after estimating a 'Taxpayer's Discount ' in SC of $42.32. Utah $0 - Utah is a quarterly filing state, with the subsequent filing due in October 2025. Washington $606.18 - Zamp's tax-due estimate is higher because the WA B&O (a gross receipts tax due with sales tax) is $30.59 for July. West Virginia $438.07 - our estimate matches precisely. I hope the above is helpful, and please let us know if you have any questions.

I have a couple of quick questions regarding the details. First, I don't see a breakdown of gross sales and taxable sales. Do you show both amounts at $2835.39? Also, to help me understand the reports better, could you explain why there's a difference between the Zamp transaction report (which matches Shopify transactions) and the ""estimated amount due""? I understand it might be a small discrepancy ($233.97 vs $232.80), but I'd appreciate clarity on the reason. Thanks as always for your help.

Outside of a situation noted about returns below, the amounts Zamp expects to file align closely with the Shopify Report here when adjusting for time zones by including 8/1/25 transactions that occurred earlier in the morning. Just so you know, some returns (refund transactions) within the states noted below are not accounted for as Zamp is unable to file negative amounts in state local jurisdictions. Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah. That said, we can help with this and determine the best way to move forward. This is something that has only come up this month, and we haven't seen these kinds of larger differences in previous months. Would you like us to move these returns into future filing periods to ensure the tax is recovered? I'm also happy to hop on a call if that would help.

After reviewing the files further and comparing them, I've been unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the difference. I'm still seeing an estimated tax-due amount of $27,834.89 , which is net of: Refunds: $167.98 10923319327 10885185829 10896962205 10927300762 Timely filing discount: $139.87 In Zamp, we utilized an 8.25% rate for the tax collected while rounding to two decimal places (which is required for sales tax). I also don't see any missing transactions between the two files. I've attached a file showing a comparison between the Texas transactions in July 2025 from the NMI file and Zamp. Next steps: Do we have your approval to proceed with the sales tax filing in Texas? We'll need to get this filing moving into the process today to be filed on time, without any penalties or interest.

I dove into this further and realized that the difference was caused by WooCommerce transactions synced with Zamp up until August 4, 2025. I had forgotten to remove those, as many were tests and some had duplicated tax amounts. I've removed those WooCommerce transactions. Next steps: When you have a moment today or tomorrow, could you share the same NMI credit card report that you shared with us on 7/29/25 (example attached) for 7/15/25-7/31/25? Then, I'll import the data and send an updated tax-due estimate your way. Currently, we have an estimated tax amount due of $27,834.89 ( net refunds and a timely filing discount of $139.87 ) for the July 2025 filing period in Texas. My theory here is that we're missing some July 2025 transactions from the NMI report. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to hop on a quick call. If we're able to get your filings moving by the end of the day tomorrow (8/15), we'll be able to ensure timely filing."

Zamp doesn't yet support sales tax holidays either, so if they do configure their source systems (Shopify/Xero) appropriately, we'd report the correct tax. Still, the filings (taxable/gross sales) wouldn't correctly account for that piece either. For Shopify, it looks like they'd need to use Shopify Tax: https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/taxes/shopify-tax/choose-tax-service I don't know much about tax collection in Xero, but here's a very basic article about it: https://central.xero.com/s/article/How-automatic-sales-tax-works#Howratesarecalculated"

I looked into this test API calculation you shared and found that a 0 taxDue amount was returned because the Zamp Tax Code R_TPP_FOOD-BEVERAGE_HOME-CONSUMPTION (which was replaced by Z-FBV000 recently) is treated as tax-exempt in Florida. A taxDue will be returned if no productTaxCode is provided or if R_TPP ( tangible personal property, fully taxable) is used instead. Here's an example of an API call that will return a tax due amount: {

We can export from QBO and maybe look for invoices with a date in the past but were created after we would've filed. It'll take a bit of finagling and we'll want to confirm with LizAnn. I think Cloud Ninjas TechTrade would also be a good fit for QBO. That said, we'll want to confirm how the integration will handle back-dated invoices, especially since filing periods aren't locked at Zamp. It may be better for them to hold off on using the new QBO integration until we have locked periods, if they don't want to change the back-dating invoice practice (e.g., invoices added after the 5th of the month that are back dated, would still be missed...) Or, the QBO integration will work if LizAnn provides us with a list of invoice IDs that were back-dated, then we can manually use the transaction update/edit tool to move them into a future filing period."

I think that we can bring in the invoices that were ""missed"" in prior periods into a future period as long as she shares a date range or even better, a list of invoice IDs. We can compare against Zamp and figure out what happened there. Yes—I think they'd be a good fit for our new QBO integration because it places taxes on an invoice as a line item, which is what she's used to doing already. I don't believe they're multi-channel, so it should be a good fit."

I just had a renewal call with LizAnn and there are some invoices that are ""missed"" in prior periods. For example, after a period is filed, they may have invoices added with a date in the past. She is wondering best practice to make sure these invoices are rolled into a future period. Is this something that we can do on our end or will she need to provide a CSV? Also, would they be a good fit for our new QuickBooks Online integration? Thanks!"

3030096818,171243,9482394806,customer,2025-10-18T03:08:22Z,kyle@zamp.com,There is a big difference between a Marketplace designation and an Ecommerce platform. A Marketplace designation means that no tax is collected and the transaction is treated as if the tax was collected by the marketplace provider and therefore you are not required to remit and file the tax for those transactions. A Shopify transaction may or may not have a marketplace designation so we do not combine marketplace and ecommerce platforms in the api options. Those options are exclusively for marketplace designation.

We would highly recommend using the method Matt mentioned below. We'd recommend using the API name field for the original ID # from the source platform, and this way, the SBC Dynamics ID can be retained as the transaction's id (this might help avoid confusion with various clients). As long as you're passing the original ID # of the transaction, that should be sufficient (for customer reconciliation) and all of the orders from Shopify, Bigcommerce, Adobe/Magento, Shopware and Stripe can be passed as API transactions. The important requirement we talked about is passing them with recalculate set to false so Zamp consumes and reports on the tax amounts as-is for sales tax amounts that were charged outside of Business Central.

The importance of the Marketplace designation is to confirm when no sales tax is required for remittance to the states (Amazon files it for their sellers per the requirements of the Marketplace Facilitator laws). As long as you're passing the original ID # of the transaction, that should be sufficient (for customer reconciliation) and all of the orders from Shopify, Bigcommerce, Adobe/Magento, Shopware and Stripe can be passed as API transactions.

Kyle, John H or Chris - If you have any additional thoughts, please share. This is for ecommerce orders that have sales tax charged outside of Dynamics 365 Business Central and imported into Business Central for reporting. If they should use another field where they can flag the original platform (eg Shopify), it does provide customers an extra filter for reconciliation. Thanks, Matt"

3030096818,171243,9249068806,customer,2025-08-15T16:11:39Z,kyle@zamp.com,Regarding the 2 lines returned for CA freight it looks like you're hitting 2 different jurisdictional rules. If you note the compositeCode varies between the two return lines. In this case that is because you told us you shipped a line item that cost $0 but shipping cost was $100. We're returning the data accordingly and telling you that your $0 line item has $0 in tax for the sake of the line itself and a second entry to tell you what the shipping tax implications were for that line. If you followed a more traditional payload example where the shipping/freight cost was associated with the line item that is being shipped the return data might be a bit clearer. This is an intentional degree of denormalization. Regarding your second question about the registration data. I was able to query that endpoint using your token and it returned the data properly. What does your query request look like? Are you including filters?

FreightShipping support: This is a month or two out from full support. When it is fully supported we will update the API docs with the details. Until then we only support a flat ancillary rate for shipping and handling. 2. Tax total aggregation values on the api response This is an intentionally generic response body.

As a heads up, I am unable to open that sheet, but I'm assuming it's the orders from checkout champ with bad addresses on them. As we discussed, the reason that this is occurring is that the orders have bad data(incorrect address) and are not being updated in Shopify. We wouldn;t want to consume orders where the address is both incorrect and for the wrong state as that will change numbers. Additionally, if there is no sales tax being collected that could lead to further discrepancy. Our recommendation is to add address validation to your checkout champ/TaxJar integration to eliminate this issue from occurring on future orders where your customers are providing bad data. As an additional step, for orders where this has already occurred, you could send our team a CSV of those incorrect orders with the updated, correct address for our team to aggregate with your sales flowing into Zamp. We would want your team to have this sent over ASAP since we are approaching filing deadlines.

Overall, our recommendation here would be to adjust by the full amount remaining (of the duplicate tax) as the risks should be low due to the entity change and filing these returns as 'final' where we're able. This prevents a remaining credit/adjustment being necessary. So that you know, the details below won't be included in the tax-due estimate I will be sending out soon because they are states where Koio Collective has an annual or quarterly filing frequency. Although Zamp will be filing these as soon as possible (likely this month), Ashley or I will follow up to confirm. Our system won't include the tax-due estimate because the filings aren't usually due this month for annual or quarterly filing frequencies. There are two states where there will be a leftover duplicate tax amount (NJ and PA). Please let us know if you have any questions or would prefer to take a different approach."

For now, I've attached a spreadsheet detailing the amounts that have been adjusted so far, an approach of adjusting by 50% (instead of the 10% adjustment percentage), and the amount and percentage we'd adjust by if you prefer we take the full remaining amount. There are four tabs/sheets within this file: July 2025 Tax-Due Estimate Amounts with adjustments by percentage. The Remaining Duplicate Tax Adjustment Amounts. The total duplicate tax to adjust for, by state. The existing adjustments that were made throughout 2025.

I hope to have this over to you soon (likely tomorrow). Can we make more / higher adjustments in July & August given that this is our final sales tax filing? Yes—I think we could do this, and I'll review the remaining amounts and compare against the tax due to see what our options might be. If not, what will happen with our credit?

In the interest of keeping this situation simpler and to a single email thread, here's the tax-due estimate for the July 2025 filing period: The slight differences shown in the amounts below, when compared to the July files provided, are due to minor rounding differences. State Period Estimated sales tax CT July 2025 $171.00 GA July 2025 $157.33 LA July 2025 $15.99 TX July 2025 $9.47 Total July 2025 $353.79 Important —do we have your approval to proceed with the July 2025 filings? Please keep in mind that these filings will be considered late, and we aim to have them completed as soon as we have approval and our filing team can.

If we don't hear back or we're unable to proceed with the filings by the end of the day today (8/18), Sauce's filings would be moved to our overdue filings queue and likely subject to penalties and interest from the state. Please let us know how we can help, and we're also happy to hop on a quick call if that would be useful to you here."

Would you prefer if we filed with or without the 'transaction revenue' report's transactions? We could include them in next month's filing if we proceed without. Or, we can move the filings to our 'overdue filings' queue, which would be subject to penalties and interest. I'm checking with our filing team right now about the timing and how likely we can file right away if we wait past today."

Yes—I've confirmed that the transactions within Zamp match the original file. A bit of background about what caused the difference: For a while, Zamp had a CSV data-specific import limitation, which only supported 10 line items per transaction. This has since changed, and we reverted changes we made that should have broken up transactions with 11+ line items into multiple. A few of the transactions (the 14 unimported invoices) had invalid addresses with incorrect city names, but Zamp missed this, and the error was silent; we're escalating something to our engineering team to improve the handling of this in the future. The invoices with ""New York, NY 11232"" should have been ""Brooklyn, NY 11232"". The invoices with ""Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA 92007"" should have been ""Encinitas, CA 92007"". We'll look forward to speaking with you all soon!"

3026611085,169105,9221996690,message,2025-08-08T14:57:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Sandeep and Team, A quick follow-up here! I met with the customer yesterday for an hour or two, to troubleshoot further. First, I'd like to note that this customer is using version 1.0.5 of the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin (this is noted in the Sytem Status Report shared yesterday.) We tried the below steps in an attempt to isolate the cause of this duplicate tax issue, but the issue persisted: We switched the WooCommerce theme from 'the7' and it's associated custom code (within functions.php) to a default WooCommerce theme, 'Twenty Twenty-Four'. There was no custom code in the functions.php file, when this default theme was in use. We disabled all WooCommerce-related plugins, including: Additional Order Filters for WooCommerce: by Anton Bond – 1.22 AfterShip Tracking - All-In-One WooCommerce Order Tracking (Free plan available): by AfterShip – 1.17.17 The7 Elements: by Dream-Theme – 2.7.2 GAT Custom WC Error message for Rare Breed Triggers: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 DEV - GAT Checkout Boxes for Rare Breed Triggers: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 GAT Custom Functions for Rare Breed Triggers: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 GAT Remove WC Additional Info for Swag.: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 Mailchimp for WooCommerce: by Mailchimp – 5.4 The7 CLI: by Dream-Theme – 1.0.0 Theme My Login: by Theme My Login – 7.1.12 ELEX Stamps.com WooCommerce Extension (USPS): by ELEXtensions – 2.4.0 WooCommerce Conditional Shipping and Payments: by WooCommerce – 1.14.5 (update to version 3.0.2 is available) WooCommerce UPS Shipping: by WooCommerce – 3.4.1 (update to version 3.8.7 is available) ShipStation for WooCommerce: by WooCommerce – 4.5.2 (update to version 4.7.5 is available) WooCommerce Smart Coupons: by StoreApps – 7.1.0 (update to version 9.47.0 is available) WP NMI Gateway PCI for WooCommerce: by Pledged Plugins – 1.2.5 They updated the WooCommerce plugin to version 10.0.4. We removed and added 'Florida' back as a nexus state within the Zamp Tax settings. We still saw behavior with duplicate tax occurr like this: Additionally, we noticed some interesting behavior: The tax was displayed once (not duplicated) in their cart, and during checkout. Once the order was fully placed, the checkout confirmation displayed duplicate tax. The order in admin (the screenshot above) still showed duplicate tax. Interestingly, the duplicate tax was removed when the test order was canceled (this happened in 7+ test orders). An urgency update: This customer was delaying a large product launch (which needed to go live Wednesday, 8/6.) Instead of delaying further, they are reverting their WooCommerce store to it's configuration and state before installing Zamp Tax; disabling Zamp for now. They hope to have this sorted out by 9/1/25, if possible (~3 weeks.) They will be setting up a stage/testing site by Tuesday (8/12) and will share those credentials with me; I can pass along via one-time secret. I hope this helps and please let us know if we can share any additional information!"
3026611085,169105,9221182738,message,2025-08-07T14:54:30Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Sandeep and Team, Thanks for following up here! It's interesting to hear that the issue could not be reproduced, but it makes sense if it's tied to custom code or a specific WooCommerce plugin. Regarding the source code: I've attached the custom code that the customer noted they have running. This is the 'THE7-Active-Theme-functions.php.zip' file, which is attached and can be accessed after being unzipped. The WooCommerce Theme they're using is called the7 , but it is a purchased theme; I don't see an easy way to share this. I've also uploaded version 1.0.5 of the Zamp WooCommerce plugin they're using to the Google Drive folder here . Steps to reproduce the issue: 1) Install version 1.0.5 of the Zamp WooCommerce plugin. 2) Ensure the WooCommerce, WordPress, Database, PHP version, and other environment items match the details noted in the attached 'SystemStatusReport' file. This may not be 100% possible, but I'd imagine the items noted above would be a minimum necessary to see similar behavior. 3) If possible, attempt to have similar or the same plugins installed as noted in the 'Active Plugins' section of the attached 'SystemStatusReport', I think these would need to be checkout or tax-related plugins, which are: Additional Order Filters for WooCommerce WooCommerce Conditional Shipping and Payments Zamp Tax for WooCommerce 4) Add the code from the 'THE7-Active-Theme-functions.php' file to the WooCommerce store's theme function.php file by going to Appearance —> Theme File Editor —> select 'functions.php' on the right-hand side under 'Theme Files' 5) Place an order for a product that is set to be taxable and is located within a nexus state. This would be configured within the Zamp plugin's settings as noted here . From reviewing Indisea's test Zamp environment, I see that all US states with tax are enabled. I'd recommend testing this with Florida, as that is the state where we saw this behavior happen previously A quick question: Would it be helpful if I shared a login to the specific WooCommerce website in question here? This is a production site, so no changes should be made when logging in and reviewing. If yes, how would you prefer I share the login details with you? Would using One-Time Secret be OK with you? I'm also checking again with the customer about any other custom code because the plugins noted below sound like custom plugins that might be related to the issue here: GAT Custom WC Error message for Rare Breed Triggers: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 DEV - GAT Checkout Boxes for Rare Breed Triggers: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 GAT Custom Functions for Rare Breed Triggers: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 GAT Remove WC Additional Info for Swag.: by Joseph Simoneau - GAT Marketing – 0.1 object-cache.php: Redis Object Cache Drop-In"

I've attached the custom code that our customer has running in their WooCommerce store theme's functions.php file, and I think there may be a WooCommerce 'hook' priority issue with the section shared below, as I believe Zamp's plugin utilizes the default priority of '10.' // Add Choice to Session
add_action( 'woocommerce_checkout_update_order_review', 'cb_checkout_donation_choice_set_session' );
function cb_checkout_donation_choice_set_session( $posted_data ) {
parse_str( $posted_data, $output );
if ( isset( $output['donation_choice'] ) ){
    WC()->session->set( 'donation_chosen', $output['donation_choice'] );
}
}

// for max 2 order 
add_filter('woocommerce_quantity_input_args', 'limit_product_quantity', 10, 2);
function limit_product_quantity($args, $product) {
$args['max_value'] = 2; // Set maximum quantity
$args['min_value'] = 1; // Set minimum quantity 
return $args;
}

add_action('woocommerce_after_cart_item_quantity_update', 'limit_cart_quantity', 10, 4);

    WC()->cart->set_quantity($cart_item_key, 2);
    wc_add_notice(__('You can only purchase a maximum of 2 of this product.'), 'error');
}
} Normally, I'd suspect that the above code could cause duplicate tax to occur at checkout. However, the customer's technical resource noted that tax is still duplicated when this is disabled (he also had it disabled during our testing yesterday). I've also attached the plugin-zamp-tax.log files from today (8/6) and yesterday (8/5). The testing and items we worked through were at these times: 8/5 - 12:00 - 1:30 PM EST 8/6 - 1:30 - 2:30 PM EST Additionally, the customer's WooCommerce store status report is attached, including various versions, plugins, and other details. One other item I'm waiting on from our customer here is more information about their WordPress Database and if tax rates still exist in the tables noted below. This is a new area for me, and we appreciate any guidance on other places to look. wp_woocommerce_tax_rates wp_woocommerce_tax_rate_locations Lastly, a question: Would it be helpful if we shared the login credentials the customer provided for their WooCommerce store? If so, they've authorized us to share the access, and it is admin access; they ask that no changes be made."

Here's some additional context shared by the folks running into this behavior: I've already tried disabling the relevant function.php file codes in the theme's files and also deactivated the checkout-related plugins, but the double tax issue still persists. It's quite strange that the tax is still being applied twice despite these steps. In my mind, this doesn't necessarily rule out theme-related issues. Still, it leads me to wonder if there's some database or leftover rate/record issue related to AvaTax (or previously configured manual rates). I look forward to hearing what you all find!"

3026611085,169105,9213850323,message,2025-08-05T19:29:22Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Team, First of all, thanks for your help with this situation and on many other fronts! We are running into a situation with a new customer using the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin where the sales tax on an order is duplicated at the order-level and seems to be occurring at the line-item-level 3-4 times. This issue is likely caused by custom code, but we (and the customer's technical resource) are having difficulty untangling it. Tomorrow (8/6/25), the technical resource will try disabling all custom code and troubleshooting from there. Here's an example of what we're seeing: Troubleshooting Notes: Troubleshooting for duplicate/triplicate tax issues on WooCommerce orders in admin (the order confirmation email shows this as well): We ensure the Zamp tax settings were correct - the API token, nexus states, and the 'Default Product Tax Code' were set to 'R_TPP', and the Diagnostics page showed the message ""Configuration looks good!"" Their Woo tax settings looked fine: All prices and display options are set to ""excluding tax"". Shipping tax class set to ""Standard"". The 'Display tax totals' set to ""As a single total"" (the behavior persisted with this setting set to ""Itemized"" as well). We ensured the product in question (shown in the screenshot below) was: Set to taxable. The tax class was 'Standard'. No Zamp tax code was configured as the product is taxable. We first deactivated the AvaTax plugin as it was still enabled, and then completely deleted it. The customer's technical resource disabled some custom logic within the store's theme that was affecting the cart and product quantity. After that, we tested the following. Zamp's API logging showed the tax calculation requests coming across properly, and the taxDue returned was $36.33. An export of the logs is attached. The Zamp Tax logging in WooCommerce also appeared fine. I will ask the client's technical resource for a copy of this, as they had to end their day (they're based in India). We cleared or deleted the following under WooCommerce —> Status —> Tools: Delete All Tax Rates. Clear Transients (cached data). Manually removed all Tax Rates from WooCommerce —> Settings —> Tax —> Standard Rates. Still, tax is showing up 3-4 times on the item, and twice on the order-level tax lines. I let the technical resource know that Zamp's plugin calculates tax and stores it in the store's cache for 5 minutes; it is cleared when the item, a coupon, quantity, or address changes. Additionally: The cart cache is cleared when our plugin notices these hooks being updated: woocommerce_cart_updated woocommerce_checkout_update_order_review woocommerce_applied_coupon woocommerce_removed_coupon Questions: 1) Are there any items or settings that we should also check? 2) Do you know of any WooCommerce database methods/actions/queries that we should run to specifically clear any tax rates, cache, or items related to AvaTax after deleting the plugin? 3) Are there any hooks or classes within WooCommerce or the Zamp Tax plugin that could be causing this behavior or interfering with Zamp's plugin logic? 4) Does any of the behavior occurring here align with areas of improvement already found by the Indisea Team? Please let me know if you have any questions or if any additional information could be helpful here."

I need to be able to print a PDF of the Transaction Report for each month, quarter, 6mos, or year, that shows all of the info on the Transaction Screen and if there are multiple pages, all of them need to be included. The CSV Report is cumbersome and not print friendly, nor does it show the Total $amount for the time period. Subtotaling by State would also be helpful, and it would correspond to the State filings Currently, Zamp does not have a report that matches precisely what you're looking for. That said, I will share this request with our team and we'll follow up once we have an update. This kind of request aligns with some items our Product & Engineering Teams have planned for later this year. One of these upcoming features is a state-specific sales tax filing report that would include these amounts. That said, I've shared this request with our team. For now, a way to do this would be within Excel, summing the amounts in the 'transactionSubtotal' column or by creating a Pivot Table in Excel. I've attached an export from your Transactions page doing this, and the Pivot Table is on the 2nd sheet. I've modified this report a bit, to be accurate and clearer because our export from the transactions page includes repeated rows for a single invoice, which is how our previous QuickBooks Online integration would display transactions (Each row was a line item on the invoice.) Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I've escalated your question about eliminating the journal entry step necessary to offset and clear both tax-related accounts in QuickBooks Online to our integration team. I don't believe this is a feature included in our upcoming QuickBooks Online integration, but it's a good piece of the process to find an automated solution for. I have an idea for this, and I'll follow up if we have an update. We've also imported all of RecRe's QuickBooks Online invoices for July 2025. I've attached an export of the transactions from Zamp for your review, and they can also be found on this Transactions page . We will follow up about any outstanding items related to the June 2025 filing within the July 2025 email thread (with the subject 'RecRe, Inc.) since we've almost completed a thorough review to confirm that all changes were accounted for. Have a wonderful evening and a great weekend!"

Please note that there are many missing invoices because we have moved RecRe's QuickBooks Online sales data process into a manual process for Zamp to follow, which will increase accuracy and reduce the possibility of missing invoices. The above was supposed to be shared with you previously, and we'll address that internally to ensure it doesn't happen again. We'll review these details and the items you brought to our attention on 7/2/25, today, and this week. We'll follow up within a business day. Regarding your most recent question: Can this extra step be eliminated? I'm unsure if we currently have a way to eliminate this step, as it is a bookkeeping step that occurs within QuickBooks Online. Our current integration and processes are separate from Journal Entry and account-type steps within QuickBooks Online. That said, when we're able, we'll explore if this is a feature included in our upcoming and improved QuickBooks Online integration."

Please address this and respond back to me. We also have a problem with the way sales tax is showing up in Quickbooks.  When I do an invoice the tax amount shows up in the appropriate Sales Tax line on the invoice.  The amount is listed as a Payable for the individual Sales Tax authority.  When the tax is paid, it is withdrawn from a separate account - Sales Tax Payable.  The accounts offset but a Journal Entry must be done to clear both accounts.  Can this extra step be eliminated?

One item to note is that the Transaction ID 7293113532478 ( HOS4524684418 ) was tied to an order in Shopify, where Shopify was collecting as a marketplace facilitator, which is why Zamp lists it as a $0 tax transaction; this Shopify Tax Transaction Report also shows this by setting the 'Is filed by channel' column to 'yes'.

I've been investigating and working through this issue today, as it seemed like a more urgent and immediate priority, given the current sales tax holiday. I was able to make some updates using the workaround steps I shared previously for the DormCo store. This store now has the following 0% tax rate set for an OH zone For the other 3 stores noted below, I was unable to add a zone/rate or edit the existing OH zone/rate, as I received the same endlessly loading/spinning page you received. Byourbed Coma Inducer Dorm Haul For these stores, I ended up deleting the OH Tax Zone and Basic Rate that was previously configured, and here's an example with 'Coma Inducer' showing the zone is no longer there: I tested the tax calculations on each store within the store's cart, as I'm also located in Ohio, and ensured no tax was returned. My plan after this is to re-enable Ohio (within the 'Provider Targeting' for Zamp) on the 15th at midnight, when the sales tax holiday is over.

We're currently investigating a potential solution for this because at the moment, Zamp does not yet support sales tax holidays. Still, I may have found a way to force BigCommerce to use a 0% rate in Ohio (using a combination of Basic Tax manual rates and Zones , along with the provider targeting noted here to unselect/turn of OH for Zamp.)

They might be able to create a custom tax class and Zone in BigCommerce to do this, as discussed in this blog post . Likely, the best route would be to leave Zamp enabled and also set up some manual tax rates (with 0% rates) for Ohio. This should be able to work with Zamp based on what I've read in this BigCommerce article . They would essentially turn Zamp ""off"" for Ohio-only by using the provider targeting setup noted in this BigCommerce article , which should cause the manual rate + zone (Ohio) to be used. Zamp doesn't support sales tax holidays at this time.

While we don't yet know the exact timeframe, we'll follow up once we have a better idea. Also, can you send us the API token? Sure! Your API Token is available in this one-time secret link . A couple of quick questions: 1) Are you testing this within a staging or test WooCommerce environment? 2) If so, would you like us to set up a sandbox Zamp account for you? I'm asking this as utilizing the API token above would cause any transactions in a 'processing' or 'completed' status to sync with the Zamp account if the transaction sync is enabled, which we can delete later on once testing is complete, so either way it is OK (some folks we work with prefer to keep test and production environments separate).

Apologies for the double message-our Tech Success team just shared some detailed guidance regarding WooCommerce product categorization that they asked me to pass along. It's much more in-depth than what I previously sent, so I wanted to make sure you had it (see below).

They also offered to hop on a call next week if you'd like to discuss the recommendations further-just let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Caroline

For WooCommerce, they can set Zamp tax codes for each specific product by following the steps outlined here and also refer to the options here . There's also a section in WooCommerce -> Settings -> Zamp Tax -> Tax Codes and Zamp Tax -> Bulk Tax Codes, that they can use to set tax codes for many products. Here's the Tax Codes area: This is the bulk tax codes area: The product categories they're referring to here are categories that they (or their team(s)) create within WooCommerce, so it's a bit different from Shopify, and WooCommerce shares more detail about that here .

This is what that area looks like under WooCommerce -> Products -> Categories: The categories are completely separate (and self-defined/grouped) in WooCommerce.

Our WooCommerce plugin has functionality built into it that adds a ""property"" or way of adding a Zamp tax code to each product, so they'll handle assigning the tax codes we recommended by following these articles: https://support.zamp.com/article/60-zamp-tax-for-woocommerce-product-configuration https://support.zamp.com/article/89-zamp-for-woocommerce-handling-variable-products (only if they have variable products.)"

Chrismer, please let us (Zamp) know if you have any questions or items to discuss as the Chykalohpia Team works through solutions here. A few promised follow-up items from the Zamp side: Zamp's WooCommerce plugin uses the below WooCommerce hooks to interact with the cart and the WooCommerce cache: The plugin uses WordPress transients ( set_transient() and get_transient() ) to store tax calculation results. The plugin will clear its cache when these hooks are triggered: woocommerce_cart_updated woocommerce_checkout_update_order_review woocommerce_applied_coupon woocommerce_removed_coupon When the shipping address changes. A custom function may be hooked into the above WooCommerce actions with higher priority. The code associated with Zamp's tax calculations can be found in the following locations within the 'zamp-tax' plugin's code: includes/core/class-zamp-calculations.php includes/core/class-zamp-tax-provider.php The transaction sync, including the bulk transaction sync (which didn't work while on our call this morning), can be found in: includes/admin/transaction-sync The bulk or historical transaction sync is primarily handled through the code in includes/admin/transaction-sync/class-zamp-transaction-sync-batch.php . This process creates batches, processes them, and schedules them. Our plugin is using the WordPress Action Scheduler in batches of 25 for background processing. I hope this helps, and please let us know if you have any questions!"

The tax figures are now appearing correctly, which is a big step forward! We did, however, have to temporarily disable the quantity adjustment feature on the checkout page. During our testing, we found that updating the quantity would clear the Zamp tax calculation, causing the tax to revert to $0. The Zamp team confirmed they use caching for these calculations, which is likely the cause. Chris and I have verified the new tax calculations are working as expected and have already pushed the changes live to the production site. We (Chykalohpia Team) are actively looking for a solution to sync the tax calculations with quantity updates and will let you know as soon as we have a fix in place.

I hope all is well, and I just wanted to check in and share some recent findings. @Chrismer - Our call was scheduled for today from 3:00-3:30 PM EST, and I waited while checking some additional items within the staging site, but you were unable to join. I understand that life and various situations happen. I'd still love to connect and discuss what might be causing the tax calculation or transaction syncing issues we've run into. Question —When is a good day and time for us to meet? Are there times that might be outside a 10 AM through 8 PM EST schedule that work better for you? I can adjust my schedule or initiate the call scheduling from my end to enable this flexibility. We can reschedule using this link or schedule a new call with this link . Recent findings: While reviewing various items and testing in the staging site, I found that with the Stripe Tax plugin deactivated or completely deleted , the Zamp plugin initially returned a tax rate and amount. Strangely, after the checkout page finishes loading, the tax amount is reverted to $0. With the Stripe Tax plugin no longer in the picture as it was likely causing a conflict, I was also able to see tax rates and amounts within the WooCommerce store's logs for Zamp, and I confirmed that similar logs were available on my end (within Zamp's logging). That said, a bulk Transaction sync (utilizing Action Scheduler) was still unable to run and didn't appear to have been initiated. Questions: Does anyone know of any custom checkout page items or custom code that could affect or clear Zamp's ability to display tax during the checkout process? Is it correct that Elementor is utilizing ""wc-blocks"" as a part of the Gutenberg Project, which WordPress introduced in the Summer of 2017? Are there any interactions, plugins (e.g., the advanced-cache.php drop-in plugin here ), or customizations that might be clearing the cache during checkout after the tax is added? Zamp's plugin is designed to cache the tax rate for 5 minutes, unless a product or address-related item within the cart changes; then, the cache is cleared for a calculation to rerun."

Ideally all transactions from 4/1/2024 through 6/12/2024 so we have the data needed. At a minimum the data for Texas for 6/1/2024-6/12/2024 so we can match up this filing.

Looking over the report for June 2024 for Texas in comparison to the transaction data we have for the same time period it seems the report you sent in has a higher gross sales amount and a higher collected tax amount. You're report: $86,427.60 total and $345.19 Zamp transaction data: $57,680.06 and $287.96 for 136 transactions.

The details you've shared here make sense, and it sounds like QuickBooks Online's automatic sales tax calculation service may view graphic design services differently, or they're targeting the "" Custom graphic design services that may include inconsequential tangible personal property "" towards something different from what Zamp would expect here. In this situation, it may be best to utilize the ""Nontaxable"" setting under ""Other options"" as I was unable to find a category that sounds like it would match the tax-exempt expectation here: Once Zamp's updated and greatly improved QuickBooks Online Integration is fully and finally approved by Intuit (we're still waiting, and have followed up), you would be able to utilize Zamp's tax codes instead.

Regarding shipping taxability in Florida: I've confirmed that Zamp currently treats shipping as taxable in Florida, and we share more details about that in this guide . The short version is that as far as we know, the product can't be picked up in Florida as it's shipping from Arizona; Zamp also either treats shipping as taxable or tax-exempt (at the current time). Regarding the tax rate for transaction INV-4268732-001's address: The 6% rate would be correct here. We've confirmed using the Florida Department of Revenue tool here that this address falls within an 'unincorporated' area of Collier County, which is subject to a 6% sales tax rate instead of a 7% sales tax rate.

Our team reviewed this and were able to fix the issue. You should now see 1,883 transactions for that period. Please note, the reason why not all 1,899 transactions are not showing up is there was unusable shipping data for those transactions. At minimum, we need city/state or zip code. If you would like to update these transactions with this information, we can then upload these transactions. I have attached the document with the transactions we couldn't import. Please note, 3 of the transactions were shipped to the Virgin Islands, which we don't support so we will not be able to import these 3. Let me know if you have any questions.

Summary of the request: We're aiming to have a new column added to the Zamp Dashboard to display the Invoice Number for each transaction. Please see the attached screenshot for reference: According to Zamp Support, this can be achieved by updating the API integration so that the Invoice Number is passed as the transactionName in the API calls.

Here are some notes related to your specific requests: Invoice No. - We use the transactionName that Keylight's integration provides, but if one isn't provided, we fall back to transactionId . Keylight would need to update their integration (specifically, their API calls) to include the Invoice No. as the transactionName . Then you would see this displayed. Currently, and as shown in the example below, the only transaction ID value provided to us is the ""hidden"" or unique Transaction ID from KeyLight. Zip Code - Please note that if you export the transactions from your transactions page or click on the transaction, the zip code will be displayed. The ""export"" option is in the upper right-hand side of the transactions page. Account Name - Not currently available Account Number - Not currently available We will add these as feature requests to our team. However, this is unlikely to be something our team will be able to implement in the near future. Here's an example of an API call from Keylight showing that the same ID value is provided for a transaction's 'id' and 'name'. Please also note that 'name' becomes the ID value displayed on your transactions page and is the same as the 'transactionName' in the transaction export. {
  ""id"": ""2w1x0rhhvbo212szp8p1tace"",

Did you want to review the Keylight integration further or should I send the following - Hi Rangi, Thank you for your feedback regarding the Transactions view in the Zamp Dashboard. I have added some notes below next to the specific requests - Invoice No. - We use the transactionName that Keylight's integration provides, but if one isn't provided, we fall back to transactionId , and Keylight would need to update their integration (specifically, their API calls) to include the Invoice No. as the transactionName .

3018317209,166724,9189488722,note,2025-07-30T00:02:24Z,chris@zamp.com,"@christine - some answers here: Is the invoice number not the Transaction ID? It should be the transaction ID, but as I recall from our call with Pronto/KeyLight, this ID is set by the specific values KeyLight's integration is designed to put. We use the transactionName that Keylight's integration provides, but if one isn't provided, we fall back to transactionId , and Keylight would need to update their integration (specifically, their API calls) to include the Invoice No. as the transactionName I'll review more tomorrow to confirm for sure, but it looks like Keylight's integration is providing the following: An id in the API call which translates into transactionId They are not providing a name in the API call which translates into transactionName Zip Code can be seen when they click into the transaction. Yep—they can click into the transaction or export the transactions to a CSV file; then, the zip code will be displayed. This could be a feature request to pass along to the builders. Still, I'm unsure how likely it is to happen unless we implement some customization feature that lets customers ""pick"" the columns displayed (adding a zip code would make the page seem cluttered, in my opinion). For account name and account number, should I just let them know that I will add this as a feature request but we will not be able to implement this in the near future? Yes—this is something that would be a feature request and Keylight (or someone) would likely need to update their API integration to use the Zamp API's metadata property so that their integration could store ""custom"" fields like account name or number; then that would tie into a feature request to allow customers to customize the columns of information displayed on the transactions page."

First, our team has grown, and we're implementing numerous improvements to prevent delayed responses in the future. Second, here's what I found internally at Zamp about how Handwrytten should charge sales taxes: Our understanding was that Handwrytten offered various digital goods/services, which are billed to a customer who might be different from the person receiving the item. In this situation and understanding, the recommendation was to charge sales tax based on the billing address. This is what I've gathered from various conversations and notes on the Zamp side. General details to share: Generally, sales tax should be charged based on the billing address for digital goods/services, as items aren't physically shipped. Then, if physical goods are shipped, sales tax would be charged based on the shipping address . Next steps: Do you think the above details help here? Would you like us to run any specific scenarios by our Tax Research Team for additional confirmation?"

That being said, this is indeed the billing address of the client, not mailing address of the recipient. I know David mentioned this when I first started with Handwrytten that Zamp was using billing address for invoiced orders instead. Is this method for the API integrations compliant? I thought we were obligated to calculate based on the recipient address/where the physical product is delivered, but understand each state has different regulations and the scale of data changes things. I wasn't here for the start of the partnership so just want to refresh on the process! Thank you, Allie"

For their API transactions, I'm not sure if we're receiving the Shipping or Billing address, but it could be either. The reason I say this is that Handwrytten's API transactions send us a single address. Also, this is an integration that was built by Handwrytten or a third-party technical group they worked with; it was before my time at Zamp. Is there a ticket somewhere in HS or notes in some tool that references it? (Would've been working with Ryan.) A way we could ask them is: Here are some recent API transactions within Zamp, for ID X.

Could you please explain what logic you use to handle precision differences? Sure! In general, Zamp will round amounts either up or down, but always to two decimal places, when calculating the taxDue for a transaction or jurisdiction. The above means that Zamp is always rounding to the nearest cent, with a precision of $0.01. The specific logic involved varies from state to state, as some states require sales tax to be rounded up, while others require it to be rounded down. Would it be helpful to you if we ask our engineering team for additional details here, at least for California?"
3016679908,166239,9183799435,note,2025-07-28T16:46:34Z,chris@zamp.com,"@carie - Yes, I think this could be a support article, pretty much noting that Zamp has all kinds of sales tax and state-specific logic built into rounding for calculations, transaction creation, and by jurisdiction, where required by various state rules. In some scenarios, we round up and in others, we round down, based on state or jurisdiction-specific logic. In general, Zamp rounds to two decimal places as our API and app don't accept more than 2 decimals."

We checked the logs you mentioned and it is not clear to us why both cases returned an error 400 even one error case contains the shipping address. There is no information we retrieved from the API why this 400 happened. The only difference looking at these cases are the products and the states. Thus, FL worked but MA failed.
support@zamp.com Is there a way to check the same timestamps on your end?

It is about the following id's in Production:

While checking the logs, I came across two recent transactions with errors in the Zamp integration: Example 1 Example 2 I'm wondering if these issues might be related to the integration syncing the Shipping Address instead of the Billing Address . That's just an assumption.

Instead of calling the ""calculate tax"" API, they are calling the commit transaction API. This is why all calculations are showing up as committed. This is being fixed & tested right now. We will have a patch out as soon as possible. Thanks, Kevin"

We've been trying to access the staging site, but I'm wondering if we're using the incorrect URL. Could you ask Chrismer if the URL below is correct and if there's an email address associated with the Zamp_tax user? The URL I have for the staging site is: https://arlenecyclestg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-admin/ I keep getting redirected to an Arlene Cylce staging site login that only accepts email addresses (not usernames without an email address), and the alternate WooCommerce/WordPress URLs I know of are not working for me. This is the URL I'm redirected to: https://arlenecyclestg.wpenginepowered.com/login/?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Farlenecyclestg.wpenginepowered.com%2Fwp-admin%2F&reauth=1 If it simplifies the situation or speeds this up, I'm happy to reach out to Chrismer as well. I had held off on doing so, as it appears this is tied to a ticket with a team he's a part of. Although it sounds like turning off and deleting the Stripe tax plugin didn't resolve the situation here, I'm hoping to obtain Zamp-related logs and other system logs that can help accelerate troubleshooting and find more information to resolve this situation faster. If we want to schedule a call with all of us, or just Chrismer/his team and I, I'm still happy to do that, and we can schedule a call like that using this link ."

I've successfully updated the API keys from the Zamp sandbox environment and disabled Stripe Tax, as discussed. During my testing, I followed the steps provided by the Zamp team, but the tax calculations are not yet appearing correctly at the checkout stage. To ensure a swift resolution and accurate implementation, I believe the most efficient approach would be for the Zamp team to directly access the site and troubleshoot the issue.

In these scenarios, it should be fine to issue the refund through Stripe and then notify us when this happens. We can then review the Stripe Transactions within your Zamp account and adjust for the refunded tax accordingly. Our typical recommendation would be to void the transaction with tax collected, and create a new transaction without tax after the customer has been marked as tax-exempt in Stripe. That said, I understand this may not be simple when Stripe subscriptions are involved, and this will likely mean we need to take a manual adjustment approach on the Zamp side for now. To ensure we're on the same page and that the tax is accounted for correctly, could you please share an example Invoice or Transaction ID that requires a tax refund? I'd like to review how our Stripe integration handles sales tax only refunds in this situation. After that, we can help adjust for this transaction and recommend the most efficient approach for all involved when handling these situations in the future."

I've attached two examples of our research, our GLP-1 piece from July 2023 & our more recent piece on PFAS & Water, as attachments to demonstrate those baskets. Unfortunayely, I cannot extend the rate on individual unaffiliated subscribers to your institution, as that would be unfair to the dozens of other firms paying for access (even if they only use one seat). I can offer your firm a 10% introductory discount in perpetuity however. I hope you understand. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

This address is very close to the parish line. The coordinates in the Zamp rate admin are within Bossier Parish, while the address and the LA rate finder are correctly indicating this should be within Caddo Parish. 1. 8.35% is correct. 2. The issue is the coordinates for this address from our provider are incorrect. 3. Your best bet is to look up the address in the state rate finder. Whatever county is indicated, you will then insert the county/parish name followed by gis, interactive maps, or property search. Then, you can try and find the address. Occasionally, you may have to check the next county over if you are unable to find the address and you suspect it may be close to or over the county line. For this one, I was able to find it by searching ""caddo parish gis"", then choosing the link from arcgis.com. Kyle - do we have a fix for addresses that are pinning within an incorrect jurisdiction, causing the incorrect rate to be returned? I apologize for the slow turnaround, I have a pretty long backlog I have been trying to work through. TODO : once a fix is released, follow up with the customer."

The 8.35% rate is the correct rate for this Shreveport, LA address.

I am answering the questions throughout this thread, but please let me know if I'm missing any, and we can cover those in another email or during our call tomorrow morning (8/19/25, I'm in EST/EDT). 1) The Ship To address, line 1 field, and error: Could you please guide us on which specific "" Ship To address "" field in Keylight corresponds to this requirement? Yes—this shipping line 1 field would need to be set to null within Keylight, and this is likely something that would need to live within Keylight's Zamp integration logic, or code. We can talk about this more during our call tomorrow. One workaround for this, while testing or before any integration updates are made, is to enter ""a"" or some letter other than a space or leave the field empty. This corresponds with Line 1 of the Ship To address, but I'm unsure which exact field in Keylight that this corresponds to. Within Zamp, it will be this property: shipToAddress.line1 2) For the error ""Invalid US zip: 8070 means that Zamp's system was unable to accept the zip code as it should have been 08070 (with a '0' in front)"": If this transaction didn't sync due to a missing '0' in front of the Zip Code, why are other transactions with similar missing '0's appearing in Zamp? Could you please re-investigate the actual reason why this specific transaction did not sync? Just to let you know, this is the error we see within Zamp when the transaction creation attempt occurred. When this happens, this means that Zamp received ""8070"" as the zip code instead of ""08070"". Additional investigation or reasons this occurred would need to come from investigating the settings or invoice/transaction fields within Keylight, and the Keylight Team would be able to help here best (or whoever owns supporting situations like this within Keylight). 3) As for the extra transactions in Zamp (Zamp has More Transactions than Keylight), these seem to be related to four accounts that we don't recognize. Could you please help investigate it? Sure! I can share information about what we see within Zamp, as we (Zamp) do not have access to Keylight, and this is a relatively new system to us. We're happy to learn from you all and the Keylight Team, and add some documentation on our end to capture those learnings (internally). These four transactions have the following details in Zamp's logs: They were created between 1:34 and 1:41 PM GMT on July 22, 2025. The day they were created appears to be the day that the transactions were made within Pronto's Keylight environment (I'm referencing Zamp's record of the transactedAt here.) Below are the IDs (an invoice or transaction ID) that we have for these transactions, and I believe these IDs may be internal but searchable within Keylight: tjjr6uxg9j-rg-mu2807idyh ar0n-q6c_yf2380vss7_a5k7 aka0toe31qlbcum0fns8wh_h dgq4xjerx3_88i9o_kdcsksf I've attached the logs we have for these transactions in case it's helpful. If these were test or incorrect transactions in any way, please let us know, and we can delete these transactions from Pronto Marketing's Zamp account. Please let us know if you have any additional questions."

Based on our recent reconciliation of Keylight invoices against Zamp transactions for July 22-28 (after the API connection), we have a few follow-up questions and observations: Does Zamp pull data based on US Zip Codes? Do all US Zip Codes need to be exactly 5 digits for transactions to sync correctly? We've noticed several Keylight invoices that are not appearing in Zamp transactions. In most of these cases, the zip codes are either 4 digits or missing. However, there are also some invoices with 5-digit zip codes that are not showing up in Zamp. Could you please investigate these discrepancies further for us? We want to ensure all data is accurately captured. Thanks & Regards, PoM"

Regarding New Jersey: I investigated this further and found that the two transactions noted below (as two of the IDs shared on 7/22/25 were the same but had different amounts) contained errors in our API logs related to address data. The API responses (including status codes and error messages) and logging data are in the attached XLSX file, and we'd recommend sharing this with the Keylight Team 7a58pdl93e0kr-4v6fx0rgk9 - the error String must contain at least 1 character(s) means that line 1 of the Ship To address needs to either have at least one character or value, or be null . In my API testing, I usually set line 1 to null if I just want to use a zip code when creating a transaction. k4xxy1an97j1614jr-tm7wi_ - The error Invalid US zip: 8070 means that Zamp's system was unable to accept the zip code as it should have been 08070 (with a '0' in front). To resolve situations like this, we recommend allowing leading zeros in zip codes or implementing Zamp's Address Validation API endpoint to help prevent such issues from occurring. Regarding the other discrepancies and findings: We've started investigating this, and we hope to have more details to share by next week. If we think the differences here may be related to the bug Kevin noted yesterday, please let us know. We're happy to investigate this now or work with you if you have questions after the bug and underlying data have been improved.

While we await your investigation into the missing New Jersey sales on 22 July 2025 (from our previous discussion), we've identified some additional data variances that require your expertise. We'd greatly appreciate your help in investigating these discrepancies and providing insights into the root causes, or guiding us on how we can work together to resolve them ASAP. Here are the details: CSV Data vs. Zamp Transactions (May 1, 2025 - July 11, 2025): Observation: Namtarn sent a CSV file on July 15, 2025, containing 1,899 US invoices (Invoices + Credit Notes) for this period. However, Zamp only shows 42 invoices for the same period. Request: Could you please help us understand the criteria or process for uploading transactions from CSV into Zamp? We need to clarify why there's such a significant difference in invoice count. API Integration Variances (July 22 & 23, 2025 - Post-API Activation): Observation: We've reconciled the API data for July 22nd and 23rd and found two types of variances: Missing from Zamp: 5 clients/invoices from Keylight are missing from Zamp transactions, totaling $735 ($229 on July 22nd, which aligns with Rangi's information, and $506 on July 23rd). (Please refer to: Excel file: KL vs Zamp (1-23 Jul 2025) > sheet API_Issue_22&23Jul2025 > rows 1-12 for details) Zamp has More Transactions than Keylight: Zamp shows transactions totaling $48,549.87 more than Keylight ($33,048.82 on July 22nd & $15,501.05 on July 23rd). (Please refer to: Excel ile: KL vs Zamp (1-23 Jul 2025) > sheet API_Issue_22&23Jul2025 > rows 15-54 for details) Request: Could you investigate these specific API discrepancies? We need to understand why certain Keylight transactions aren't appearing in Zamp, and why Zamp has additional transactions not reflected in Keylight. Missing from Zamp: Zamp has More Transactions than Keylight Our goal is to ensure complete data accuracy and a smooth integration process.

After reviewing your nexus numbers we can confirm that these are correct.

At the same time, Zamp's Economic Nexus Analysis uses the total sales in a state (gross sales less discounts), and Zamp doesn't include refunds/returns in the threshold analysis. We also include shipping in our threshold analysis.

After reviewing further, I found that the significant difference in Total Sales for the Texas Q2 2025 period (4/1/25-6/30/25) was due to the recalculation of sales tax for the bookmarks that was previously done. After redoing and correcting the recalculation work, we now have the total sales numbers for TX: Total Texas Sales: $5,711.00 This includes $196.00 (rounded up from $195.65) in sales in TX through Amazon. This includes $5,515.00 (rounded down from 5,515.19) in sales in TX through Shopify. This is made up of the $5,483.79 Net Item Sales amount and the $31.40 Total Shipping amount. Taxable Sales: $5,515.00 Resolving this difference also changed the estimated tax due to $452.72 , which includes $282.35 of tax that was collected and $170.37 in tax that was not collected; Zamp recalculated accordingly. I've triple-checked the amounts and work here; these are accurate. Do we have your approval to proceed with the TX Q2 2025 filing now that the amounts align with Shopify?"

3003562231,162209,9208901051,message,2025-08-04T17:07:53Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Andrew, Thanks again for your patience! After thinking this through a bit and triple-checking the various items involved with economic nexus thresholds in visible's remaining states, we've confirmed that either path for reporting your B2B Transactions to Zamp should work here. I'll outline those details below. 1) Regarding the manual, CSV, route: As this is the preferred path, we're OK with taking this route if you prefer. The CSV file would need to meet the guidelines outlined in this article , and I've attached an example CSV template. One caveat here that will differ from the article is that the adjusted template accounts for visible selling of physical items and Software as a Service: We would need to know which row in the CSV file for a transaction (identified uniquely by the transactionId and there can be a single row per product type) should have the SaaS tax code assigned, which is R_DIG_SAAS_B2B for B2B (or R_DIG_SAAS for B2C). I added an extra column to the template for this, which has a header titled itemProductTaxCode . 2) Regarding manual invoices in Stripe, to be imported automatically: If a manual invoice is raised, we'd recommend including the devices and memberships as single line items while utilizing the quantity field (or similar) for the number of devices and memberships. Within Stripe, if a product is created for the B2B memberships, it appears that the Stripe Tax code txcd_10103001 would fit, and Zamp would automatically map this to Zamp's tax codes, as we currently do for your non-B2B transactions. This could impact the threshold reporting in various states because our Tax Research Team recently confirmed that the majority of states determine if the Gross Sales amount crosses an economic nexus threshold on a transaction. This means that discounts and refunds are not considered in Zamp's economic nexus analysis. Suppose the invoices are created on a per-user basis instead of a single transaction, in the states where we haven't seen visible cross a transaction count threshold which includes Arkansas, Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. (These states also have a dollar amount threshold.) The other remaining states do not have a transaction count threshold and only have a dollar threshold instead. I hope this is helpful, and please let us know if you have any questions!"

Currently, all of our sales are direct-to-consumer via Stripe (which, of course, integrates seamlessly with you). For a particular B2B deal, we'll be selling 150 devices and memberships in bulk to a Californian university, who will then distribute them to staff and students. We're currently at 60% of the $500k CA threshold, and this transaction would take us up to 80%, so no issues around tax collection, we're more looking for guidance on how best to handle the threshold tracking in this case. A couple of options we were considering: Manually import the transaction into Zamp via CSV, alongside our regular Stripe-collected transactions. Preferred. We can raise an invoice outside of Stripe. Raise a manual invoice in Stripe and have Zamp handle tax collection as you do with our usual B2C sales. Slightly cautious with this, as reporting may be impacted (and also individual tax thresholds - see below) due to the way our Stripe is currently set up. In addition, we plan to activate the memberships via 100% discount in Stripe for each of the 150 users, but unsure if this may create tax threshold implications on a per-user basis - could you comment on this? Be good to get your input. Thanks in advance! Andrew Long Financial Controller"

I've ensured the transactions Bobbi found were adjusted correctly, and from now on (until there are more programmatic ways to deal with Order Edits), we'll keep partially_refunded Shopify order statuses as a part of the usual month-to-month process. I'll be more careful in the future. What happened here is that I did not adjust for these paritally_refunded transactions after reviewing what I thought were transactions adjusting properly, and that caused the issue Bobbi noticed. I've also reviewed transactions back to March 2025 at Bobbi's request and confirmed that the partially_refunded transactions from 3/1/25-6/30/25 are all accounted for. I've attached the updated supporting documentation for this process. A new tax-due estimate will be sent out in the next few minutes. Please keep in mind that we'll want to expedite these filings through the process as quickly as possible to ensure timely filing. However, I have given it an extra day due to this situation. I hope you both have a great time off. Please let me know if you have any questions."

NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED -- please hold off on approvals/processing.

New issue:
When we do an EDIT ORDER (eg a size change from XS to S), we know already that we need to manually minus out the 'duplicate' item - since only 1 item was shipped.
However, it seems if the shipped item ends up getting returned for refund anyway, Zamp is NOT recording the tax adjustment for that returned item.

Example order: Only 1 item ordered -- price $195. Only 1 item paid. Size changed from XS to S/4 (via Edit Order). See 3 line items in Zamp calculation below: Because of the edit order, Zamp currently thinks 2 items were sold, for a total of $390 with $34.14 in tax. There seems to be a manual deduction (I think by Chris) that deducts the 1 duplicate item, resulting in -$16.27 in tax. However, after the item actually shipped (S/4 size in this example), and the customer decides to return for refund, we should get a negative tax adjustment of lets say $16.27 or $17-- but that's missing now. Chris -- please have a look at this example, and we can discuss today before 5:30pm EST if you have time.

We are out of the office on Thursday and Friday, so would need to review today.

And then once we find the logic issue here, let's pls go back and search for and adjust for all similar cases (Edit Order + Refund afterwards).

Thanks,
Jason"

First, we're happy to share that our engineering team has released some significant improvements since mid-June that now properly account for these transaction scenarios with Shopify transactions: Voided/Expired transactions - we now create a separate refund transaction to account for these. I validated this by reviewing voided orders within a Shopify export and comparing them to Zamp. Partial refunds that are not order edits are captured, and I validated this by reviewing 'partially_refunded' orders within a Shopify export and comparing them against Zamp. The above means that I made adjustments to Shopify Transactions within Zamp by reviewing 'partially_paid' and 'paid' transactions from a 'web' source with a positive outstanding balance. Please note that the process we previously agreed upon remains unchanged, except for the updates mentioned above regarding voided/expired/partial refund adjustments. We also have additional work scheduled to start in August 2025 to reattempt finding a solution for order edits within Shopify. Meaning—there's a chance these adjustments won't be necessary in the future, but we don't yet have an exact timeline. I've also adjusted for the remaining prior period refunds in California and Colorado. I've attached three files: A file showing the Shopify adjustment transaction work. An export of the Zamp Transactions for states with filings this month. This includes a Pivot table showing tax amounts by state. The tax-due estimate I sent previously is also included in this file. The prior period refunds brought into June 2025 for the previous periods. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Although I don't currently have a transaction-by-transaction tax rate file to share, I've identified the cause of the difference in tax due expectations here. Regarding Pennsylvania: We found that for PA, just the state rate (6%) was collected on some of the transactions, which did not include any locals (there are two in PA), and this ties into some details that Matt Grattan shared on 7/10/25 around ensuring not to overcharge customers when rates change throughout the state, and over time. Once we recalculated the PA Transactions to match Zamp's expectations, the tax-due estimate was updated to a number closer to your expectation. The estimated tax-due amount is now: $4,291.38 . This includes a timely filing discount of $43.35. Regarding Texas: Texas is a bit of a tricky situation, which we share more details about here , with Business-to-Business Software as a Service (B2B SaaS) because our understanding and Zamp's calculation engine considers the below information, which differs from a flat 8.25% rate across the board: Texas considers SaaS a data processing service, which subjects it to an 80% sales tax on the service's price. This also means that 20% of the price of a SaaS service in Texas is considered tax-exempt. The above leads to the following amounts and breakdown, which align with the tax-due estimate for TX: A taxable sales amount of $7,810 - these are sales to non-exempt entities. The original non-exempt total sales amount (excluding non-profit sales) was $9,762.78 , which the taxable amount noted above represents as 80% of. A tax-due estimate of $644.33 , less a timely filing discount of $3.22 , for a total estimated tax due of $641.11 . The above means that the $ 641.11 tax-due amount is our estimate of the correct amount, considering the taxability of SaaS in Texas. A question and next steps: Do we have your approval to move forward with filings for both Texas and Pennsylvania? These two states have due dates of the 20th this month, and we want to ensure timely filing. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

2998871080,159999,9126033333,message,2025-07-11T22:02:44Z,adewberry@zamp.com,"Hi Anjali, I hope that you are doing well! I'm jumping in for Chris to help assist with your questions: The Q2 payments (for example, New York) is a prepayment that is required by the state that will be applied to your quarterly return due in September. California also requires prepayments which were made in May and June that will be applied to the California Q2 return that is filed this month. Due dates vary by state. For example, Maine is the earliest due date (the 15th) while California has a later due date (the last day of the month). Most states have a due date of the 20th. We remit on your behalf to each individual state so you will see a separate remittance for each state. It's hard to say exactly when the funds will be pulled from your account as our team is actively filing as the reports are released but we will file and remit prior to the applicable state due date for a timely filing. I hope this helps to clarify and please let me know if you have any further questions, Ashley"

Our engineering team confirmed that Zamp doesn't currently support sales tax holidays. At this time, we're unable to find a good workaround because BigCommerce allows custom products and shipping rules. Still, the limitations on shipping usually come from third-party apps (which won't prevent the display of the product to non-Florida customers). Something like this may be possible with custom development and access to technical resources. If that's possible, the gift card product tax code (R_TPP_GIFT-CARD) would be treated as exempt in Florida and all US states. Please let us know if you have any questions."

The taxability of shipping varies from state to state, and in all kinds of scenarios; we're here to help with that. Labor may or may not be taxable depending on the kind of service involved. What types of services would you be referring to? We have a few that might fit this kind of category, but this may also be something to run by our Tax Research team for confirmation. These are the categories we currently support: The "" TPP "" below refers to "" Tangible Personal Property "", which is generally taxable products. Regarding the PDF you shared and CCF_000129: I reviewed this further and also triple-checked some items within your Zamp account for your Texas sales tax registration. I found that when Zamp registered Accelerated Tooling LLC in Texas, we registered you with a 'Single Local Tax Rate' license type in that state. This is similar to other simplified sales tax rate licenses and programs in different states, and it's typically used by out-of-state businesses. The Single Local Tax Rate for Texas with this type of sales tax registration is 8% on all transactions, regardless of the shipping address. For this order and considering shipping taxable, $3.36 would be 8% of $42.00 . This means that a single sales tax rate is collected on orders shipping to customers within Texas, and here are some resources about this: Under ' How to Collect Sales Tax on Interstate Texas Sales ' in our Texas Sales Tax Guide, here . On the TX Comptroller's page here . I hope this helps, and please let us know if we can assist with anything!"

After reviewing the tax calculation logs on our end associated with the WooCommerce store here, I'm seeing a few different Tax Due amounts returned by our API for this zip code on 7/4/25 Within Zamp's API logs, I can see 6 calculations with a subtotal of $24 and $0 shipping cost. Then, I also see a final sales tax calculation with a subtotal of $24 and a $18 shipping cost. I'd like to see how the order looks on your end because Zamp would consider shipping to be taxable in Texas, and that might be the cause of the difference here. A few questions: 1) Was this order placed on 7/4/25? 3) Could you also please share a screenshot of the order from within WooCommerce with me? Regarding your question: Please advise as to how this is being fixed. Should we be able to trust this software? Of course! Once we confirm the situation and the taxability of the order, we'll be able to help determine what, if anything, needs to be fixed. Yes—you should be able to trust the software, and we're here to help answer questions and ensure any items are resolved."

We should have GunBroker added as a supported Marketplace within Zamp by the end of this week. I'll keep you updated about this. So that you know, Zamp must have the marketplace designation for GunBroker sales configured to treat them as marketplace sales for your nexus calculations.

Usually, importing the data would take a day or two, but we've had some unexpected delays. We're putting multiple items in place to prevent this, in the future (including hiring some new folks). We currently have your eBay Transactions importing into the MN Pawn America Zamp account. We've started working through the website sales, but I have one question (below). Aside from the Gunbroker sales, we should have all the data imported into Zamp by tomorrow (October 21, 2025). Once we have resolved the question (below) about Gunbroker sales and our engineering team adds Gunbroker as a supported Marketplace, we'll be able to import those transactions. Regarding Gunbroker: Question —Do you or your team know what GunBroker's EIN/FEIN or Tax ID number is? This may be included on any legal/tax forms or documentation that is not publicly available. One route to request this (if you're unsure of the ID) is to contact their support at support@gunbroker.com or submit a ticket/question from their Help Center page here . Zamp will need the GunBroker Tax ID number to ensure proper and compliant sales tax filing in a few states that require us to include a Marketplace's Tax ID number when filing sales tax returns, one of which is Oklahoma. Without this information, we would be unable to import the Gunbroker sales. Regarding your API question: Also, how can we test the sales reporting API? You or your team can test the sales reporting API, our /transactions API endpoint, by following the documentation here and using the API keys linked below. Please note that these API keys can only be viewed once. We recommend saving the API keys in a safe location before closing the browser/tab. [Sandbox] Pawn America Minnesota API Key [Sandbox] Pawn America Wisconsin API Key In our experience, this type of testing is typically performed once an integration is built, using a script or an API tool such as Postman (or a similar tool). Our /transactions API endpoint here is used for creating transactions in Zamp for reporting and filing purposes. We share our Transaction Object here . We also share important details regarding refund transactions here . Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

No—our eBay integration is currently not working, and we do not have a timeline of when that might change.

Notes: Jackie said that Asal is concerned about the amount, and they think we're doing this right, but the Shopify Report is making this tricky. There is confusion about how returns are handled because Shopify separates orders, returns, shipping, tax, and other amounts. For example: Jackie seems to understand what I'm saying, but it sounds like Asal is either confused or looking at some different report/export. I think maybe they thought we were deleting the duplicate Loop transactions, but we're just creating refunds (""Returns"") to offset that duplicated amount. I let Jackie know that we do this because our Shopify integration could resync the duplicate Loop transaction if a change is made to it (by Loop, Shopify, a customer, someone at Cult Gaia, etc) so we take this path to make sure the amounts match the Shopify Reports; tax is not duplicated. Jackie said she'd check with Asal's assistant and see if we can all get on a call to ensure we're on the same page. Again. Closing this until Jackie or Asal replies."

2996360340,158110,9166952738,message,2025-07-23T14:00:53Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Jackie, Thank you for the responses and for providing additional context. Yes—Zamp accounted for the Loop Returns with duplicated tax for all states. This is something we check each month before sending the tax-due estimate and adjust for in all states, regardless of whether a filing is due. Additionally, our engineering team has a roadmap item scheduled to start next month that will add a feature to support accounting for this specific scenario. This means that ideally, these adjustments will happen automatically in the future. didnt we talked abt this last time? and you can even see what loop has duplicate charge. I am confused why you would dig in when i am assured that this was happening? Yes—we confirmed in previous calls and emails that Zamp is accounting for the duplicate tax charges on the Loop returns, and this is something our team accounts for each month. When returns were noted, I didn't initially realize that this was related to Loop returns (as there can be other return types within a Shopify store.) I'll ask more questions next time. I think it would be better to provide a monthly report that would clearly show the calculation. Sure, I'll note this on our end and we'll do our best to provide something showing the returns (refund transactions in Zamp) as we move forward. Just so you know, these returns (refund transactions) can be found in the export shared on July 9, 2025, and the adjustments for these returns always include the text ' loop-discount-adj ' in their IDs. Here's how to find these transactions within the export/report we share: 1) Add a filter in Excel (or whichever software is used) to the transactionTax column (L) to display only transactions with a negative amount to see all refund transactions associated with returns: 2) To see the transactions we created to adjust for the duplicate tax that occurs with Loop returns or exchanges. Add a filter in Excel to the transactionId column (A) for the text ""loop-discount-adj."": The adjustments we make should always have "" loop-discount-adj "" in the transactionId for quick identification. For now, I've attached two spreadsheets: Containing all returns. Containing Loop-related duplicate tax adjustments, which offset the duplicate tax from Loop. Please let us know if you have any questions. We're still happy to schedule a call (or call at a time that works best for you today) to discuss this further."

This file focuses on states with overdue returns, and it is simplified in some ways, but includes both the 'Tax Collected' amount and 'Tax Due' amount. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

The difference you're seeing here is that within Zamp, we'll import the transactions with the amounts listed in the Stripe or QuickBooks Online (post currency conversion) export files, and Zamp performs a behind-the-scenes calculation to calculate the tax-due estimate. As for the overdue filings, they seem a bit too low to be using the new method. Is there some sort of transaction listing we can pull to see how each number was calculated? We've made a note of that, and we're looking into this urgently. Yes—we have a report that we can build showing the tax amount Zamp would estimate to be due for these periods. We'll get this together and can cover it on a call (or share here, if that's easier.) Sure! We can schedule a call to confirm these details and compare the calculations. This should help us ensure we're still on the same page and catch any root causes of differences."

This resolves the difference discovered for the June and Q2 2025 filings. 6727 6675 As we discussed during the call, the process below is what we'll use going forward until we (Zamp) are notified otherwise: We'll recalculate the tax on any B2C Transactions (usually coming from Stripe). We'll also recalculate the tax due for any B2B (QuickBooks Online) Transactions that are not tax-exempt. I've updated the above processes that we use and also notified our filing team of this change.

I just got back and I think there has been a bit of a misunderstanding - the B2B transactions need to be recalculated as well with Zamp.

That sounds like a good plan to me, and we'll have until mid-next week to move the filings along in the process. A quick note: We recalculated the tax for the B2C sales because tax was already collected on all of the B2B sales within your nexus states. After fixing a bit of detail with the currency conversion (utilizing a conversion rate of 1.37), the amount due is lower, but there is now an amount owing for Iowa. On our end, we show tax being calculated as out of pocket for LumiQ, which is: $113.52 in Ohio. $69.86 in Iowa. Have a wonderful weekend and enjoy your OOO time!"

Zamp records amounts/tax/etc based on the payment date - following accrual accounting practices. Zamp also files in each state by adjusting for the state's specific timezone. In the GA Report, the top-level taxable sales appear to be state-only. While the rest of the sales are broken out across the varying local jurisdictions. We also confirmed that the product and associated tax code David Protein uses is treated generally as exempt in GA (but taxable at local maybe, at least according to Shopify.) The bar/energy/protein PTC they're mapped to from Shopify —> Zamp is actually a ""snack food"" PTC in the new food & bev guide. According to the taxability chart for GA, this is a state-level exemption, and locals aren't necessarily exempt.

After a thorough review of the situation and verification of a few key items, it appears that the majority of the discrepancies in tax collected are related to the items noted in this article . Primarily, we're seeing a $44.77 difference between Zamp and Shopify for the tax collected amount. A small (percentage-wise) difference like this is usually caused by rounding or a timezone difference, but timezones don't appear to be involved in the root cause here, as David Protein is based in New York. The other cause of a difference here would be that Zamp will list the tax collected as $0 for any Marketplace transaction, which includes Shopify SHOP transactions, Amazon transactions, and other marketplaces listed here . Also, Zamp's Transaction exports are what we call a ""line item export,"" which means that the transaction-level details (starting with 'transaction') for Shipping and Handling, subtotal, discount, tax, and total are repeated across rows with the same transaction ID if there are multiple line items within the order. This can inflate any summing of those columns with a formula or pivot table, and here's an example of this: A way that I've adjusted for this in the past is to use the formula below with conditional formatting while selecting only the values within the 'transactionId' column: =COUNTIF($A$2:$A2, A2) > 1 I've attached a Zamp April 2025 export for Georgia, which shows this with the formula, conditional formatting, and filtering (by color) applied to the first sheet. The data I would sum, review, etc., is on the second sheet. I'm also happy to discuss this during a call. Another potential cause of these differences is related to manual (or programmatic, through a third-party Shopify app) changes or edits made to Shopify orders after they have been processed. For example, we've seen the SplitOrder Shopify app (recently, with a different client) create duplicate transactions and increase tax when it ""splits"" transactions into multiple orders and the tax is kept on the ""new"" orders. The difference in gross sales (or the sum of transaction subtotal or line item amount) can occur due to specific logic that ensures only the tax collected is remitted to the various states when filing sales tax returns. To ensure we're on the same page, was the concern primarily a difference in the tax collected, the gross sales (or net sales when accounting for refunds), or both? Overall, there are numerous moving pieces to this, and we should schedule a call to discuss further."

However, when comparing Zamp with the customer's assigned RevRec amount, there is a small difference. Important: The customer is comparing the tax amount from Marketplace and return transactions using a line-item file. Key Findings: The discrepancy primarily stems from Amazon transactions (the customer added a column in the file to identify the 'source' ) For regular transactions, the difference is 44.77. After transforming the export into an order-level file and aggregating returns with regular transactions, here’s the summary: Transaction Type Zamp - Shopify Shopify - RevRec Zamp - RevRec Marketplace 0 -186.78 -186.78 Regular 22.77 22 44.77 It would be important to check with the customer why they are not using tax in their comparison for these Amazon transactions.

I've also attached those transactions. I moved forward with the plan outlined on 8/8/25 to account for missing partial refunds with tax, without tax, the missing DormCo BigCommerce orders from Q2 2025 (moved into July 2025), the missing DormCo BigCommerce orders for July 2025, and the partially missing orders for August 2025. After these adjustments, the amounts align and we've finally solved the various puzzles here. Next steps: I'm sending the tax-due estimate out, and ideally, we would have approval to move forward tomorrow ( 8/15/25 ) to ensure timely filing, but considering this situation, and that this is DormCo's busy time of the year, we might be able to flex a bit there.

A team member, Lucas, and I dove into the data over the last couple of days to ensure no piece of the puzzle was overlooked. We found that, in addition to the partial refunds missing from June 2025, the orders from the BigCommerce DormCo store were also missing. This happened because the checkbox shown below was not enabled for the DormCo store. We enabled this setting today (8/8/25), and we plan to import the missing transactions if you agree with this approach. Based on my research of internal notes and previous email conversations, I have the following understanding of the migration from Volusion to BigCommerce. Still, please let me know if any of this is incorrect. The Volusion data was provided via CSV and imported into Zamp through March 2025. The DormCo BigCommerce store data should have been synced with Zamp from April 1st, 2025, and forward. I've attached a few files showing our findings, and here are a few notes about these files: The first file, starting with 'DormCo - Missing Store', contains all of the transactions from the DormCo store from 4/1/25-8/8/25 that we could not find in Zamp. This comparison was made by using an export from BigCommerce and comparing it against an export from Zamp. We've also added a pivot table showing the tax amount by state. The second file, 'Master - Analysis - DormCo', shows a few different areas within each sheet: A set of ""offset"" transactions intended to be imported into Zamp to account for the difference between the incorrect full refund created by the BigCommerce integration, when the refund was a partial refund. A set of partial refunds that were missing within Zamp. A set of partial refunds without tax, as far as we know. A consolidated sheet containing all transactions. Pivot tables showing the amounts for GA, OH, PA, and CA. Note: The amounts are close for GA, OH, and PA, within reason for timezone differences to be the cause. I'm still reviewing items with CA because there appears to be a larger difference between Zamp's June 2025 tax-due estimate ($1,936), the missing transactions, and the remaining difference between Taylor's estimated amount for Q2 2025. I know this is a lot of information, and this is your busy season. We're aiming to resolve this and ensure accuracy. We've also put some items in place to prevent this from happening again in the future. We also have improvements coming to our BigCommerce integration that should save time for all involved. We're more than happy to sort this out over email or by scheduling a call, whichever is the easiest for you. A few questions: 1) Do you agree with the findings so far, and do we have your approval to proceed with importing the missing transactions along with the partial refund adjustments? We would import these missing transactions into the July 2025 filing period (with 7/15/25 dates) to ensure the tax is accounted for and remitted to the states. We also have an option to spread that tax out across future filing periods, if that is preferred. 2) Are there any pieces of the various situations that we might be missing? Once we have this data imported, we'll send out DormCo's tax-due estimate for the July 2025 filings. Have a great weekend!"

Next steps: Compare a DormCo store export from BigCommerce to the transactions in Zamp to ensure we don't import transactions that already exist, which would create duplicates. Sum the tax amounts for the missing transactions by state after the step noted above. Sum the tax difference between the partial and full refunds from BigCommerce, utilizing the file(s) Taylor shared. Before sharing our findings, I'm going to research a bit to confirm: When the transition from Volusion (CSV imports) to BigCommerce occurred. Use that detail to ensure we have a clean transition, without duplicate transactions. I'll share our findings with Taylor and Jeff; confirm the above.

We investigated this further and found that the cause of these tax differences wasn't due to sales tax under-collection within QuickBooks Online or another system. The differences are that the amount listed on your Zamp account's Filing History page is a combined amount of the Tax Due, Penalty, and Interest due. Penalties and interest apply in situations where overdue or past-due filings are processed; the state itself assesses these penalties and interest. Here are the amounts for each overdue period that have been filed and the amounts confirmed, so far: Colorado October 2024: Tax Due: $1,120.18 Penalty Due: $596.56 Interest Due: $13.83 Amount Paid: $1,730.57 Colorado November 2024: Tax Due: $1,437.87 Penalty Due: $619.20 Interest Due: $14.98 Amount Paid: $2,072.05 Colorado December 2024: Tax Due: $2,034.80 Penalty Due: $446.63 Interest Due: $6.54 Amount Paid: $2,487.97 Nevada Q4 2024 and Q1 2025: $0. This can also be seen by downloading and reviewing the return and payment upload files available on your Filing History page here , after clicking on the specific filing row. Although there are still slight differences here (less than 5% of the total tax due), these kinds of differences are typically due to items such as Zamp utilizing multiple time zones (PST, MST, CST, EST, etc) vs Shopify (or QuickBooks Online) using a single time zone based on that system's timezone configuration (Shopify utilizes the primary address associated with a store, I believe), rounding, and other items noted in this article . We've confirmed that your Zamp account is configured correctly, that potentially difference-causing third-party apps are not currently in use within your Shopify store, and that the data looks normal from what we can tell within Zamp. I hope this helps, and please let us know if you have any questions!"

We don't yet have a definitive update as we've had some unexpected delays on our end. Still, so far, it appears that tax wasn't under-collected, and the differences between Zamp and QuickBooks Online are likely related to the penalties and interest associated with the tax payments here. This can happen when sales tax returns are processed as overdue filings; Zamp filed these 2024 returns in February through March 2025. We hope to have a more thorough update to share tomorrow (7/25)."

Please share the details from step 11 with us securely, as noted above, and we will then add the Shopify integration within your Zamp account. Just so you know, the permissions mentioned above are specifically tailored to our integrations, enabling us to access the necessary data. We only need the customer's shipping address information; we don’t import their name, phone number, or email. We only import shipping so that we can calculate sales tax for filings.  The same read-only situation applies to orders, products, locations, and any other permission we're requesting. Zamp can’t change anything in their Shopify store since it’s “read-only” Please let us know if you have any questions! Best, Chris Ralph Technical Success Zamp"

That said, we (Zamp) would need to know which specific transactions are ones that occurred through the Shop sales channel within Shopify; there are a few ways to determine this: In the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report, these transactions are categorized under the ""Filed by Channel"" category, as Shopify shares here . In an order export from Shopify, the ""Channel"" is noted as ""Shop"". Then, within Zamp, we would treat these transactions as marketplace transactions with a designation of ""SHOPIFY"" to ensure tax is not remitted twice. Do you have any Shopify channel-related details being funneled into the system, through which these reports are built? we are not paying sales tax twice This could be the case, but I'm unable to know for sure, as the data provided to Zamp doesn't indicate if the transaction occurred through the Shop channel or not.

South Carolina: There is an invoice #12189 for Genesis Healthcare, Inc. that is missing from your report. I'm not sure why. That is $176 of tax. LA, when I drill down I get only June information from your pivot table. 2) South Carolina - we'll import invoice #12189 into the July 2025 filing period to ensure the tax is remitted to SC. Louisiana - according to Zamp's records and the LA tax license/registration we have for Jidoka Systems, LLC (Compliatric), our understanding is that you're assigned a monthly filing frequency for LA, which is why I shared only the June 2025 data. Were you expecting LA to be filed differently? Sure, I really don't know how you were getting them in the first place. But I am good with us improving our processes.

I've been investigating this further, along with assistance from others on the team. So far, we've been unable to pinpoint the differences occurring with LA and SC. For Ohio, the difference appears to be caused by Zamp having a sales tax amount ( $119.88 ) associated with INV-12356 , which QuickBooks Online has $0 (I'm guessing the tax here was removed). For Washington, the difference was caused by the B&O tax required to be remitted along with the sales tax, and the B&O tax amount was $73.46 . Once this is factored in, we're left with the expected sales tax amount of $1,435.87 . Questions: 1) Would you like us to create a refund transaction for INV-12356 (in OH) to recover the $119.88 in tax that wasn't collected during this current filing period (H2 2025)? 2) Do you see any causes of the LA and SC differences in the attached file?

Then, we'll want to figure out how to account for that in the July filing processed in August; maybe create a special handling todo."

I see what you're saying regarding the line item IDs, and it is also helpful to know that the Zamp application hasn't been customized. It sounds like there shouldn't be other customizations in place outside of Zamp that could affect this process. Regarding Access to the Affordable Screen Co Dev site: I believe that our Integration Team had access at one point, and I'm escalating this situation to them for further review. If I found out that they need access again or they'd prefer I have access, I will follow up here to share the necessary details for that access. A few outstanding questions for Ébano or Maier: 1) Could you please share any of the Zamp-related logs associated with the Order IDs and dates below? Logs for the date range of 8/13/2025-8/21/2025 should work here. The Order IDs in question are 000040361 (Texas) and 200105956 (Minnesota) The above details will help us confirm that the missing tax collection for those orders is the same as the Pennsylvania orders, or if it differs. I've narrowed down Zamp's logs to 65 different API calls for TX and MN addresses. 2) This may be a question for Matt—could you also please share the Ship To zip codes for the 000040361 (Texas) and 200105956 (Minnesota) orders? 3) What is the current version of the Zamp Extension that is installed?"

Is there anything that we need to do about the previous prepayments or the NY password? I'm assuming that filing has things in place to handle these areas, but I'm checking. If we're all set, just tag me and I'll retrieve the ticket and close it. :)"

2989710154,153933,9108587826,message,2025-07-07T22:49:08Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Grace, Thanks for your patience with this! We looked into this further, and we've confirmed that we see the following California prepayment amounts within your CA CDTFA account: Prepayment 1 - $13,517.14 Prepayment 2 - $16,714.24 The tax-due estimate sent earlier this month did not account for those prepayment amounts; however, our filing team will take these into account when filing the return. The above means that the amount Zamp would estimate to be filed would be closer to $21,395.62 after subtracting those prepayments. Please note that, since New York follows a fiscal quarter (e.g., Q2 is June 2025 through August 2025), Zamp's tax-due estimate for NY would be considered the first prepayment associated with the NY Q2 2025 sales tax filing. A few questions: 1) Considering the above, do we have your approval to proceed with ETERNE's filings this month? 2) Regarding NY—if you'd like us to confirm the prepayment and filing amounts for this state, could you please reset or update your NY password and share it with us? We were unable to log in due to an expired password here. The password could be shared securely using this one-time secret tool."

Please could you also confirm receipt of the request to switch the Shopify Zamp connection back to the live Zamp account this Friday ? Yes—we will switch the Shopify Zamp connection back the production Zamp account and I've set a reminder on my end to ensure this is completed tomorrow morning (7/11/25.) Please can you confirm orders look correct in Zamp? Yes—the orders look correct within Zamp. After further investigation and comparison, I found that the order count difference was due to: Shopify does not create separate refund Transactions (it's noted within the order), but Zamp does create separate refund and order transactions. This happens because Zamp utilizes a ledger-based accounting approach, which creates a clear line of separation between orders and refunds. Some orders were not synced to the Zamp Sandbox account because they had order dates before the initial sync range (in April 2025); the initial sync was 5/1/25 and forward. After resyncing transactions, the order count totals match, when accounting for separate refunds. And also confirm the UK time window you'll be switching the Shopify connection to your live instance? Sure! What UK time window would be best for you all here? I usually start my day around 9 AM EST (1 PM UK time), but we can also target  a later time up to 11 PM EST (4 AM UK time) if that's better. Otherwise we can check with the broader team to see if anyone has a different availability. Please let us know if you have any questions."

Most of the differences appear to be related to the following items: Timely filing discounts in each state. Our tax-due estimates automatically account for these. For CO, this discount is $93.96 For SC, this discount is $11.72. Rounding NC appears to fall into this category, and possibly time zones as well. Time zone differences between Stripe and Zamp: Zamp would file using EST in NC and SC. We'll file using MST in CO. We see these kinds of differences commonly with Shopify, but similar logic would apply to Stripe, depending on the time zone used in Stripe's reports/views.

2988109476,153080,9202486676,message,2025-08-02T00:31:55Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Kwandwo, You're welcome; thanks so much for your understanding here! Overall, we've found that there appears to be no uncollected revenue (or orders) synced with Zamp. A teammate, Lucas, and I worked through a comparison of the Declined/Expired Authorize.net transactions Google Sheet and an export of the transactions within your Zamp account. The tricky piece of this situation is that the Order IDs are not the same between Authorize and Shopify or Zamp. To work through the comparison here, the strategy was to compare based on the customer email, transaction total, and shipping zip code. Overall, we were able to find 5,881 of the rows (or ""payment transactions"") from the Authorize file in Shopify; this is ~47%. We also found that within the transactions we were able to match, 2,793 of those are duplicates, meaning multiple Authorize.net IDs linked to a single Shopify Order ID. During the comparison, we came to the following working theory: We found that many of the failed payment attempts (declined/expired) eventually had a successful payment, and we also noticed a couple of things: Authorize.net records each payment attempt, regardless of whether it's successful. Zamp and Shopify both record the successful payment, and Zamp only receives the successful transactions from Shopify. Shopify records the failed payment attempts in a Shopify order's notes, but each overall order that has a status of Some examples of what we shared above are listed below, and please note that these links should open directly to the order within Shopify: #124687 #123888 #130191 #121587 #121609 We've uploaded an Excel file in the Google Drive folder here showing the comparison we worked through, if you'd like to review it. We're also happy to schedule a call to discuss this. Please let us know if you have any questions. Have a great weekend!"

Here’s a summary of my findings regarding Authorize.net transactions: Data Matching Challenges: Due to differing IDs between Authorize.net and Shopify/Zamp, cross-referencing required combining email, transaction total, and shipping zip code. Match Rate: We found 5881 out of the customer’s 12567 shared transactions (approximately 47%) in Shopify. Duplicate Transactions: Within the matched set, 2793 transactions are duplicates – multiple Authorize.net IDs linked to a single Shopify order ID. Root Cause Hypothesis: Reviewing some random Shopify orders with these duplicates reveals failed payment attempts before successful completion. Authorize.net records each attempt, while Shopify/Zamp only records the success (if any). Zamp receives only the successful transactions recorded in Shopify. Examples: #124687 , #123888 , #130191 I also noticed that there is a flag in Shopify's order page indicating: Authorize.net is reviewing this order for fraud I’ve attached an Excel file detailing this analysis."

Download a CSV of the Google Sheet. Compare using the transactionId (Not the transactionName) in Zamp against the 'Transaction ID' in the Google Sheet. See if there are any results or patterns that stand out. I need to review some things for this question before we can answer this, but I can do that within the next 1-2 days.

I've broken down the details and responses into separate categories below, based on your findings and our following review. A tax-due estimate will be sent out shortly. Transactions that we adjusted: After we looked into this further, we found that some of the transactions (listed below) did need adjustments, likely due to partial refunds or order edits. 7224535154750 7236358078526 7235996418110 7235996418110 Transactions we found did not need adjustment: 1) The transaction noted below wasn't showing up in a Shopify export or report because in Shopify, it has a date of 5/31/25 at 9:09 PM, and in Zamp, the date is adjusted for the state's time zone to 6/1/25 at 4:09 AM. 7189832761406 2) The transaction noted below was sold through Shopify's SHOP Marketplace (specifically, the Shop app) and Zamp automatically marks these transactions with $0 tax because SHOP is acting as a Marketplace Facilitator for this transaction and remits the tax collected to the relevant state; Shopify shares more details about that here . 7210012540990 (aka, HOS4524612118 ) A note about this is displayed in Shopify here when reviewing the specific order. 3) The transactions noted below are related to Shopify orders that had refunds. This is tricky to compare to Zamp because Shopify doesn't issue new or refund-specific transaction IDs, while Zamp does.

We'll need to work on an offset file for the transactions involved here. The update transaction functionality isn't yet released in Admin as far as I can tell (that project is still in progress here .) For marketplace transactions, I believe we can clarify that we report them as $0 tax since Shopify handles the collection and remittance as a marketplace facilitator. Our integration automatically accounts for these transactions. This applies to the order IDs below and won't need adjustment: 7210012540990 (aka, HOS4524612118) in Shopify here . I thought there were two transactions, but she shared this one twice. We purposely zero-out the tax on these marketplace transactions; they might not be aware of that.

The reason for this is that $0 transactions within Zamp can count towards economic nexus in some states. Zamp also does not include refund transactions in our economic nexus analysis because our Tax Research team's compliance-focused research found that no state includes refunds in their economic nexus thresholds; meaning, the thresholds are analyzed utilizing gross sales (including shipping, less any discounts). 2) We have manually imported Inv#160 for the U of Florida.

2987955576,152851,9138333533,note,2025-07-15T23:19:30Z,chris@zamp.com,"@nick - for when you're back around, or tomorrow: I think we'll want to confirm with this customer if they want us to account for credit memos within QuickBooks Online, or not. We can also notify them that for now, voided invoice handling, and increased accuracy, we'll handle this via a manual import instead of our existing QBO integration. When I leave 'Credit Memos' in this QBO Custom Report (Zamp Sales Tax Review) , we have a lower total for Q2 2025. Still, if I remove the 'transaction type' credit memo filter, the amount matches the customer's gross sales expectations in the note above . Would you like to tackle that, or should I contact them? I'm going to send their notice for now. Here are the differences I noticed: Zamp: QBO:"

I did not mark it as RESALE as I wasn't sure, there is no tax. 2. I see INV 153 was voided and I also put that into the import as a return, with a June date. Part 2 CA: INV 114 is already in Zamp and the sales tax is listed as a line item, not a tax calculation. Admin shows the same amount here: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cm9n9mzms003f04ju0eqr6soc/transactions/cma74twc9009njx04iu4lsan2?timezone=US/Local&date=2025-04-01~2025-06-30 It is the same case for INV 130. Perhaps we need to refund those/delete them on admin and re-import the 2 CA transactions to show tax. What do you think?"

We would only need documentation if a partial refund for a customer located in a nexus state (Texas) were processed in Shopify for June 2025 or Q2 2025 for either Metal Mark or Dandy Lion. Sure! We would just need a CSV file containing refund transactions that match the attached template and guidance in this article , for partial refund transactions. The minimum necessary details for us to import the data into Zamp are: An Order ID. The date the partial refund was processed. The subtotal amount. Any shipping amount refunded. Any tax refunded.

We can assume that if the transaction was imported without errors and shows up on the transactions page , it was included. That said, I do see the county associated with that transaction (from looking up Elon University's address ) on the NC report, but it splits the county tax from the state tax, so it doesn't match the full amount (if that makes sense). We can dive deeper using the variance reviewing query here , and look for the transaction's ID in the export (columns A or B for externalName/externalId.) I did this and confirmed the transaction was listed, which means we calculated taxes for it and bucketed it into the NC report/summary. We should be fine here, as far as I know! :)"

Our Tax Research team investigated this and confirmed that the 11.25% rate is the correct rate here, as Lancaster City recently increased its rate by 0.75%. We have updated the rate within the underlying data, and the rate will be updated in the near future. Once this rate update has been fully applied, we'll follow up to let you know."

The city rate increased by 0.75% on April 1, 2025. We captured the code change but not the rate change. I've updated our FIRE table and the update will be visible next time we load the data (I'm not sure when that will be because we are doing updates in the next couple of weeks). 1) Is the 10.5% or 11.25% rate correct here? 11.25% is correct. 2) If the 10.5% rate is correct, is this related to something with out-of-state sellers, CA, and district or other taxes that might not apply? N/A 3) What might have caused this, and how can we fix it? This is just an oversight. We capture about 95%-97% of the updates but, inevitably, something slips through. The bigger/busier the maintenance cycle, the more likely that we'll miss something due to sheer volume. We try our best to avoid the misses."

I'll share some details below that I believe will help ensure we're on the same page. :) I want to make sure that whichever way we do it Zamp is calculating the correct tax amount that has been collected ans should be remitted. Agreed! I want to confirm this as well. The good news here is that Zamp's Shopify integration has logic in place that can look for either handling of US sales taxes: Tax exclusive - tax listed separately. Tax inclusive - tax included in the product price. As if the system assumes we are including it in the price in the USA, but we are now adding it to the price, then the system may be calculating the wrong numbers To my understanding and review, Zamp will be able to detect whether the Shopify transaction has tax included in the price, or if it's now added to the price (separately). Meaning—our system's calculations will differ, depending on whether Shopify tells us how the tax is included in the price or not. Our Shopify integration (system) will handle both situations and calculate correctly from there. As i understand it in both cases Shopify itemises the tax collected out into a line in the order so would assume the system should just be looking at this ""tax total"" line? Yes—we do look at the 'tax total' line, and we also look for a property the Shopify API provides us with called taxesIncluded , and our integration handles it from there (Based on if this is 'true' or 'false'). I hope this helps!"

Could you please share more about why this might be the wrong approach here? I just want to ensure we're on the same page, as I may have misunderstood when you noted the following. We recently updated our settings on the 26th June so that tax is now charged at checkout instead of included from the order total. When I review your Zamp account's transactions from April 1, 2025, to June 25, 2025, I see that Zamp is bucketing transactions with tax collected across various date ranges and states. My understanding is that the tax was included in the cost of items sold. I also see tax collected from June 26, 2025, to June 30, 2025. After reviewing the code related to our Shopify integration, I found that we support tax-inclusive pricing (included in the item's cost), which was introduced late last year. That said, it is correct that the best and most compliant approach is to list sales tax separately (also known as tax-exclusive pricing, where the tax is not included in the item's cost). This compliance piece focuses more on complying with sales tax regulations than on reporting and filing. We'll continue to hold Drool Arts filings this month as we discuss this further. However, please keep in mind that we need to have the various state filings moving along in the process by the end of the day tomorrow (7/16/25) to ensure timely filing."

2986671955,151845,9091700336,customer,2025-07-02T15:25:38Z,tammy@bondware.com,Regarding MI - we were not utilizing proper tax codes like Zamp does… we only knew about the Nexus of units or $$ so we were taxing the full amount of sales which is why MI was higher than you. We will file MI and take care of this one. Then going forward it should line up correctly. Thanks tammy
2986671955,151845,9091682321,customer,2025-07-02T15:21:32Z,tammy@bondware.com,Ok - good to know. Ok we are good to go then. We will file MI and we approve all the other states for Zamp to file. thank you for responding so quickly tammy
2986671955,151845,9091534224,message,2025-07-02T15:00:40Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Tammy, Thanks for the context here! We can fast-track the investigation here, considering the critical meeting on Monday, as we'd like to ensure we handle this in the way that best helps you. Regarding Pennsylvania: The tax-due estimate for Pennsylvania is $201.23, which includes a timely filing discount in PA. Here's the breakdown: We see a total tax collected of $203.32. There is a timely filing discount in PA of $2.03. The remainder of the difference ($0.06) appears related to rounding within the sales tax logic; these slight differences can happen due to the nature of sales tax. Regarding Michigan: Within Zamp, I found that $137.59 in tax was collected for customers located in Michigan.. The reason Zamp is noting that $1.40 is due is due to two reasons: There is a timely filing discount in MI of $2.80 (the full tax due Zamp calculated is $4.20 .) Within Zamp, our system is designed to view digital products (R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS) as tax-exempt in Michigan, which means we'd expect $0 tax to be collected on those transactions. This means that we see $133.39 of the $137.59 tax collected as over-collection. We have the option here to ask our filing team to file the $137.59 amount instead of the $1.40 (less any timely filing discounts). Then, later this month, we could schedule a meeting or discuss via email to determine why more tax was collected than Zamp would expect. Would you like me to ask our filing team to file the $137.59, less any timely filing discounts, in MI? Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I've looked into the invoice 461 within QuickBooks Online (including the transaction audit history), and I'm not 100% sure why the Shipping Address came over as California instead of Alabama, unless I'm missing a change or unable to see it. One way we could assist here is that we could switch the National School Choice Awareness Foundation's Zamp account from our current QuickBooks Online integration to a manual CSV import, allowing our teams to triple-check that the correct address is used. This is something that we could do temporarily (for a few months) until our improved QuickBooks Online integration is released. Questions: 1) What do you think of the above option, and do we have your approval to proceed with that path for now? 2) Were any changes made to invoice 461 within QuickBooks Online or WooCommerce that you know of?"

This might be happening because of how QuickBooks Online usually stores address data in an unstructured way.

I've looked into this further and we don't currently see any WooCommerce Transactions within your Zamp account. This may not be an issue, as you noted they're syncing to WooCommerce. However, I have a few questions to help us ensure everything is aligning as it should be. 1) What was the WooCommerce Order ID and zip code for the test Alabama transaction? 2) Do you happen to know what this WooCommerce order should show up as within QuickBooks? What is the invoice number? Was this related to Invoice 461 with the name 'Test' with a Ship To address in Foley, AL?

I'm seeing the same transactions, no WooCommerce: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clvvery8u00sut0fz78at8nr4/transactions Looks like this customer approved filings on 7/1/25, I think their sales are low while this website isn't live, as this is in line with previous month filings: https://secure.helpscout.net/conversation/2959176526/141300 I'll check though!"
2986632247,151803,9125870754,note,2025-07-11T21:05:41Z,christine@zamp.com,@chris I know we're currently having issues with the Woo integration. I asked Jam to run a report on who was using Woo and it looks like this customer was the only other one besides the ones in ONB that we're aware of or who might not be pulling in the data via CSV already. Do you know if they tried to connect the integration already? I don't see orders flowing in at all from the integration which is why I wanted to call it out

A few questions, though: 1) Is there a different file for June 2025, as this file is titled for May? If not, do you know which Order IDs are from June or where the transition between months is? The goal here is to avoid importing duplicate partial refunds and ensure we're all on the same page. We can run a comparison here, later this week or after the July 4th holiday, if you're unsure. 2) In the future, can we add the Shopify order's Ship To zip code? We can determine this from the Shopify order's ID through multiple exports, but this would significantly speed up the process and reduce the likelihood of human error."

2986513364,151677,9108668616,message,2025-07-07T23:36:07Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Kate, Thanks so much for your patience here! I've shared answers to your questions below. Please let us know if this helps! 1) The CA amount ($379.29) aligns with the taxes collected in June, but Q2 should be much higher? Yes—the amount Zamp estimates will be remitted to the state (paid/due) should align with the June 2025 tax collected amounts, and this is what we see occur with clients who California has assigned a quarterly Prepay filing frequency. This happens because our tax-due estimate already accounts for the prepayments made for Otteroo in CA: 1st Prepayment - $459.00 2nd Prepayment - $458.00 Total Prepayments - $917.00 2) Is WA is higher than what I see in shopify due to B&O tax? Yes—this should be due to the B&O tax in Washington, as that amount is $21.90 for Q2 2025. 3) Maryland in Shopify (for all of 2024) is about $130 higher than what I see on zamp Just so you know, part of this difference is likely due to a timely filing discount of $5.42; however, this only accounts for a portion of the discrepancy. Overall, this difference is likely due to the date range associated with the MD filing frequency assigned to Otteroo by the MD Department of Revenue, which is a Fiscal Annual filing frequency that covers the period from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. When you have a moment, could you please confirm the following items with us to help with this investigation? The date range associated with the MD Transaction review in Shopify.

We've made the necessary updates to adjust by an amount close to what you noted and shared in the Shopify vs Zamp comparison file. The overall adjustment we made was -$2,700.53 because the majority of the Washington Q2 2025 difference was due to WA's Business & Occupation tax (B&O), which is a gross receipts tax, not collected from customers. We include this amount in our tax-due estimate. The B&O Tax amount for Q2 2025 was $518.80 , while the difference you noted was $690.03. This means that we adjusted WA by $171.23. We're sending an updated tax-due estimate along with an increased review window time, within the next few minutes. Please let us know if you have any questions."

We can certainly understand your perspective, and we would like to partner with you to resolve this situation. A slight difference, such as 1.25% (even if the dollar amount seems high), is very likely related to time zone differences between Zamp and Shopify. Zamp's tax-due estimate and filings will use the US time zone that aligns with the state's capital, meaning we use EST, CST, MST, PST, Hawaiian Time, and Alaskan Time across the various states. We'll dive into this further and confirm if the difference is related to time zones. If that's the case, our recommendation would be against adjusting by this amount, as it would mean not remitting tax to the various states. If time zones aren't the cause, we'll find the root cause and work with you to adjust the data accordingly. We should have more details to share or questions by early next week. Have a great weekend!"

However, we can conduct a quick comparison using the Zampboni tools that Lucas built to confirm whether the issue is related to time zone differences or something similar.

If you delete the transaction now, we can manually import a refund version of this transaction to account for it. Ultimately, the transaction could be left as it is so that the original data used to file for Virginia remains intact. Then, when we manually create the refund for this transaction, we can note on the line item description that this is a refund because the transaction was canceled, never shipped, and refunded. Does the above work well for you here? The 4 day window provided (truly 3 with the holiday) is really tight. Is there any way to expand that? We appreciate your feedback and understand your perspective. We'll share this with the broader team and consider any possibilities.

I'm following up to note that we were able to account for the below invoices that were voided/refunded: SS15179 SS15730 That said, there is a larger population of voided invoices that we're unable to account for due to low or $0 tax collected in the state(s) associated with the transaction. The reason for this is that Zamp is unable to file negative amounts in any state or any state's local jurisdiction. We're currently developing a plan to move forward and track the remaining voided transactions in future filing periods. I'll also share a list with you so that we're all on the same page. We will also be following up about some duplicate transactions in our other email thread (with the subject ""Re: Incorrect NY filing""). For now, we will be sending out the tax-due estimate to ensure timely filing, as Florida is due on the 20th, but has some complex rules regarding payment submission.

This was the situation Carie and Ashley had reached out about. Did we still want to work through finding a way to address the sales tax remittance associated with that invoice?"

So we'll only have to resort to reversal/rebill style when there's a change in the address. Luckily, none of those in July. So I'll just send the transactions with the net changes. Will upload the sheet soon."
2986304928,151367,9226093263,message,2025-08-08T21:31:25Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Sean, Thanks for following up and again, sharing great questions! I'm glad to hear that they don't involve address changes! For these, should I just send the net change in the transaction as a new transaction? Yes—sending the net change in the transaction as a new transaction is likely the cleanest and most accrual/ledger accounting focused way of handling them; it creates a clear line of separation. This could be the path used for positive or negative amount changes. Would ""net difference"" transactions like these two examples be good? Or is it better to me show a full reversal transaction, along with a full replacement transaction? I think ""net difference"" transactions like this, or showing the complete reversal transaction along with a full replacement transaction, will work well here. Ultimately, I'd recommend that you take whichever path is the easiest for you here, as I know working with this system's reporting has been tricky (to say the least). Either route should work well with Zamp and ensure Earthborne Games remains compliant. Especially since we both have a good understanding of the situation and it's documented on our end. I hope that helps. Have a great weekend!"

I have a couple of these in my July submission as well. These ones are a little less complicated, since they don't involve an address change. For these, should I just send the net change in the transaction as a new transaction? For example, I have one transaction with a discount/partial refund, so I would send that amount as a ""negative"" transaction. For another, some additional tax was collected, since the tax charged was erroneously short last time. So I could just send a transaction with only tax collected, and zero sales revenue. Would ""net difference"" transactions like these two examples be good? Or is it better to me show a full reversal transaction, along with a full replacement transaction? Thanks, Sean"

(There are no entirely new Gamefound transactions for June, but make sure you saw the new BackerKit transactions on the previous email which are new June transactions.) My thought is that we should therefore show 10 June transactions, 5 which are reversals/credits of the original May transactions, and 5 of which are the ""rebilled"" transactions. Do you need me to add the 5 reversals to this spreadsheet as well, or is the 5 transactions in their ""new form"" enough? Or alternatively, do you have any thoughts on a better way to handle these? Sean"
2986304928,151367,9120643867,customer,2025-07-10T14:48:10Z,slabbe@earthbornegames.com,"Hi Chris, Just about done... So as I said, there are two pieces to this for June. First, the final wave from the old BackerKit for Minnesota sales. That's the easy part - attached in a spreadsheet. Second, the Gamefound. I expected that once I finished my transforms, which cross-reference the current state of the Gamefound data against what we have recognized as sales to date, I would show no new activity in June. I was right, except for five anomalous transactions that are showing me weird numbers. Investigating these, the best I can tell, these are orders that had to get redirected to an updated address at the last second, after we'd already given our warehouse the go-ahead to ship (and recognized the sale). The new address means the tax rate changed in Gamefound's system, and there's now additional sales tax on the orders from what there was when we previously reported them in May. But it also means we reported the sale in May to a state that is not the state where we got the product to in the end. And Gamefound's data doesn't make this clean for us - they don't give us a reverse sale in the original state and a new sale in the new state. They just make the edit and show us the final version. That's the problem with Gamefound reporting - anything new that happens to an order just changes the order, regardless of the date of the order, so it looks like the order has been that way since the beginning. There's no concept of a period closing or a change order to a transaction, just an unauditable edit. It doesn't even show you what the original ship-to state was - we have to cross-reference that in our data. The way these crowdfunding sites work means there's always going to be some weird error like this that creeps in and we won't report things like sales tax perfectly. Anyway, for these five transactions, on our end, I suppose the cleanest thing we can do is try to show a reverse sale at the original address and a new sale in the new address. I will get you the info on these five shortly..."

I checked a few customer QBO accounts (billboards, LumiQ, Forcible Entry), and those accounts still have options like the ones below with the addresses that we need: Shipping Address Ship To Billing Address Bill To We accomplish this through a custom report in QBO, typically based on the invoice list report that he mentioned. Additionally, it doesn't appear to be a QBO-wide change from a quick review, but rather an issue specific to their account. They may need to contact QuickBooks (Intuit) support by following the steps in this Intuit article . The report we usually use: The columns: This article shares some details about adding columns like this to a report, but as far as I can tell, it should be the same process they used: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/customize-reports/create-custom-reports-quickbooks-online-advanced/L1LHo5Ti2_US_en_US Maybe we can ask him to add integrations@zamp.com as an accountant user in QBO?

We highly recommend Smarty, and I'd forgotten that it was already implemented on your end (from our earlier call). 3) Perfect! At the time of my initial response, I was unaware of the underlying reason for the behavior we were seeing, and my initial guesses were incorrect.

The request and response I sent for Fortune Cir address was using Google's address autocomplete, which would explain the differences between the two. But, when I tried the request earlier, the response did not have any items in the ""taxes"" object, even when using the 46241-55 74 zip code. I just checked again and even with the 46241-55 34 zip code; the response has the correct tax rate. { ""id"": ""2ec03548-1665-49a5-8572-0b3c5b8347ab"", ""transactedAt"": ""2025-06-30"", ""lineItems"": [ { ""id"": ""27502c60-b9ff-4300-962a-a3832b2657d5"", ""productName"": ""Demo Item"", ""quantity"": 1, ""amount"": 100, ""productTaxCode"": ""R_TPP"", ""productSku"": ""SKU123"", ""shippingHandling"": 0, ""discount"": 0 } ], ""shipFromAddress"": { ""line1"": ""2021 Paragon Drive"", ""city"": ""Erie"", ""state"": ""PA"", ""zip"": ""16510-1135"", ""country"": ""US"" }, ""shipToAddress"": { ""line1"": ""5701 Fortune Cir S"", ""city"": ""Indianapolis"", ""state"": ""IN"", ""zip"": ""46241-5534"", ""country"": ""US"" }, ""subtotal"": 100, ""total"": 100 } Response: { ""id"": ""2ec03548-1665-49a5-8572-0b3c5b8347ab"", ""parentId"": null, ""name"": null, ""transactedAt"": ""2025-06-30T00:00:00.000Z"", ""isResale"": false, ""marketplace"": null, ""entity"": null, ""purpose"": null, ""recalculate"": true, ""discount"": 0, ""subtotal"": 100, ""shippingHandling"": 0, ""taxCollected"": 0, ""total"": 100, ""shipFromAddress"": { ""line1"": ""2021 Paragon Drive"", ""line2"": null, ""city"": ""Erie"", ""state"": ""PA"", ""zip"": ""16510-1135"", ""country"": ""US"" }, ""shipToAddress"": { ""line1"": ""5701 Fortune Cir S"", ""line2"": null, ""city"": ""Indianapolis"", ""state"": ""IN"", ""zip"": ""46241-5534"", ""country"": ""US"" }, ""lineItems"": [ { ""id"": ""27502c60-b9ff-4300-962a-a3832b2657d5"", ""amount"": 100, ""quantity"": 1, ""discount"": 0, ""shippingHandling"": 0, ""productName"": ""Demo Item"", ""productSku"": ""SKU123"", ""productTaxCode"": ""R_TPP"" } ], ""taxDue"": 7, ""taxes"": [ { ""lineItemId"": ""27502c60-b9ff-4300-962a-a3832b2657d5"", ""state"": ""PA"", ""sourcing"": ""INTER_ORIGIN"", ""jurisdictionCode"": ""00"", ""jurisdictionName"": ""PENNSYLVANIA STATE"", ""jurisdictionDivision"": ""STATE"", ""compositeCode"": null, ""compositeName"": null, ""exceptionCode"": ""COMMERCE"", ""ancillaryType"": null, ""taxableAmount"": 0, ""nontaxableAmount"": 100, ""excludedAmount"": 0, ""taxRate"": 0, ""taxDue"": 0, ""taxCollected"": 0 }, { ""lineItemId"": ""27502c60-b9ff-4300-962a-a3832b2657d5"", ""state"": ""IN"", ""sourcing"": ""INTER_DESTINATION"", ""jurisdictionCode"": ""IN.S.18"", ""jurisdictionName"": ""INDIANA"", ""jurisdictionDivision"": ""STATE"", ""compositeCode"": null, ""compositeName"": null, ""exceptionCode"": null, ""ancillaryType"": null, ""taxableAmount"": 100, ""nontaxableAmount"": 0, ""excludedAmount"": 0, ""taxRate"": 0.07, ""taxDue"": 7, ""taxCollected"": 0 } ] } Josh Reynolds - IT Department joshb@barcodefactory.com Paragon Print Systems | Our resources.

} To improve the tax calculations in scenarios like the above, we'd recommend either implementing address validation API calls to Zamp's /addresses API endpoint or a similar solution. That said, I believe we could improve the API response handling in situations like this; I'll ensure this is raised with our engineering team. Regarding the Lincoln Way West address and ID 9ffb7a5e-209f-4e71-9827-978ba706f105: I was unable to find any tax calculation requests to our /calculations endpoint from June 25, 2025, through June 29, 2025, for the address noted below. I believe it happened and am just attempting to trace the behavior here before sending this over to our engineering team. 525 Lincoln Way W, South Bend, IN 46601 Part of the reason I'm mentioning the above and the question below is that I'm now seeing tax rates and a taxDue amount returned for this address: {

} A few questions: 1) For the  Lincoln Way West address, did the tax calculation request with a taxDue amount occur before 6/25/25? If so, this would make sense, as the logging improvement on our end was released on June 25, 2025, and I wouldn't have access to those logs. 2) Do you all have an address validation service that you already use? There are still a few items here that I'd like to escalate to our engineering team to determine the cause of this behavior and ensure the root cause is identified and resolved. The answers to the questions above will help ensure we have sufficient context for this situation. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Now, we are seeing the full rate returned for an address after triple-checking via internal tools and our API. Here are some screenshots noting this: The tax rates noted above also match the Colorado Sales Tax Lookup Tool here : Please note that Zamp's tax rates will align with the CO's General Merchandise (Tangible Personal Property) rates, as listed in the Sales Tax Lookup Tool. The 'General Merchandise - Use Tax' rates are tied to consumer use tax rates (for individual consumers or businesses ), instead of sales tax. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions."

Yes—I have imported these transactions into TheWayo's Zamp account, and they will be accounted for within the California CA Q3 2025 filing, which is scheduled to be processed in October 2025. This applies to the transactions in the attached files. I updated the dollar amounts for the shipping tax refunds associated with CO-3371-8210 and CO-6039-7377, which are shown here: Regarding the differences you noted for #CP-2200-3112 and #CP-5704-2905: These transactions were previously omitted from my final calculation because they lacked shipping charges; this was an oversight on my part. I've created tax-refund adjustment transactions for these two Order IDs. That said, I'm unsure of the exact cause of the difference because San Francisco, CA, has not had any tax rate changes since April 1, 2025, and there was no shipping included to be taxed.

I looked into this further and found that the difference between your calculation and my estimate was more minor than we initially thought. The reason for this is that Transaction Exports from Zamp are what we like to call ""line-item-level files,"" which means that the ""parent"" or ""transaction-level"" amounts, such as those noted below, are intentionally repeated across transactions with the same transactionId when there are multiple line items (identified uniquely by the lineItemId ). My initial estimate was $396.72, and the actual refund amount with your calculations is $396.95; a difference of $0.23. This difference is likely caused by line-item-level rounding being accounted for within your current API calculations, as that was not accounted for in my estimate. In a ""line-item-level"" file, the below amount values should be counted once per row in a Zamp Transaction Export: transactionTax transactionShippingHandling transactionSubtotal transactionDiscount transactionTotal To help illustrate this, I've highlighted the rows with repeated transactionId values here: Questions: 1) Do the above details make sense, or is there anything that I can clarify further? 2) If the answer to #1 is ""yes"", do we have your approval to proceed with creating the necessary refund transactions (within Zamp, via CSV) for the sales tax refunded here at the amount of $396.95?"

Because of the process you used here, which was a good idea (and I should have used instead), your tax amounts calculated for shipping would be more accurate, as it utilized the Zamp API. The method I used was a bit rougher, as I was arriving at the tax rate by dividing the lineItemShippingHandling + transactionSubtotal by the amount of tax collected. Then, I multiplied the lineItemShippingHandling amount by this tax rate. I'll review in more detail and see if there's anything further to share. Ultimately, the amount you arrived at should be more accurate. I will have this update for you tomorrow (8/7.)"

For the period from January 1, 2025, to June 5, 2025, the total discrepancy between the historical sales tax and our current calculation is $434.05, which differs from the $396.72 estimated refund amount you provided.

This took a bit longer than expected to investigate because our Tax Research and Engineering Teams backdate the fix for California Transactions. That said, I found a way to determine the tax amount charged on shipping, and the amounts we've chosen are in two columns in the attached Excel file: Column I - the Tax Rate , which was determined by summing the transactionSubtotal and lineItemShipping amounts, then dividing by the tax amount collected for the transaction. Column J - the Shipping Tax Refund Amount , this was determined by multiplying the lineItemShippingHandling amount by the Tax Rate (Column I). Please note that we focused on the date range of 1/1/2025 through 6/5/2025 because that matches the date range that you provided, and our teams released the improvement for shipping taxability on 6/5/25. Zamp's first CA filing for TheWayo was in April 2025 for the Q1 2025 filing period. The total amount we estimate to be refunded here is $396.72 . Do you agree with this assessment, and can we proceed with including refund transactions in TheWayo's subsequent California Q3 2025 filing due in October?

I can provide a list, but I'm not entirely sure if it's fully accurate. The logic behind the list is: we exported transactions from Zamp and used the Calculation API to re-calculate the sales tax.

The likely best path forward would be to create refund transactions within Zamp for the shipping portion of the tax, after the refunds have been processed. This is a bit tricky because Zamp's API and overall system don't allow for sales tax-only refunds. We would need to associate either a shipping amount or a subtotal (tied to a line item) amount as well. Could you please provide us with a list of transaction IDs that were refunded, along with the corresponding tax amount? Then, we can create these transactions via CSV within Zamp. If the above is not possible here, we can assist with reviewing all California transactions from April 1, 2025, to June 29, 2025, and determine if we can calculate only the shipping portion of the tax listed. We're also happy to schedule a call to discuss this further if that would be helpful."

I've outlined some things below that I believe should better explain why the invoices/transactions don't appear to be duplicates to us, but please note we'd still like to investigate why the amounts appear higher than you'd expect for July 2025. If you're comfortable with this, it would involve scheduling a call or adding Zamp ( filing@zamp.com ) as a user within Stripe with a view-only role/permission, as that should allow us to review and export data to compare to Zamp. After exporting transactions from Design Bundles' Zamp account, here's a screenshot of the export using 3AKZLAUS-0001 as the example: I know the screenshot above may be hard to view, but the individual line items can be seen in the attached file by scrolling to the right in Excel or your preferred spreadsheet program. Here's how this ties into the transaction within Zamp: At the top-level, anything in the export file starting with 'transaction' will all be the same if the 'transactionID is the same, and we can tell that each row represents a line item on a Stripe Invoice by the different 'lineItemId's and other 'lineItemProductName's further to the right. I've also uploaded a quick video to a Google Drive folder here describing how Zamp's exports work and why we don't think there are duplicate transactions here. Questions for next steps: 1) Can you share screenshots or exports from Stripe where you're seeing a lower amount for July 2025 than in Zamp? Stripe shares how to export payment data here and how to export any Stripe Tax-specific reports here . The Stripe Tax export would be best if Stripe Tax is enabled for Design Bundles. 2) Would you prefer to hop on a call? I'm happy to help sort this out, either way. Another, unrelated question: When you have a moment, could you please share a screenshot of your Stripe Webhooks page here , after following the steps below? On this page, click on any items ("" endpoints "") listed that start with "" https://inn.gs "" as these will be related to Zamp. Then, click on the 'Event deliveries' tab/section. Could you share a screenshot of what you see on this page, and it should be similar to the one below? Our Team will be curious to see which pieces of the process are happening successfully (green) or unsuccessfully (red). The version of the 'Webhooks' page that you see will likely be white/gray/blue, as the screenshot below is a newer version of Stripe Developer tools. Please let me know if you have any questions!"

2975444259,148536,9052787223,customer,2025-06-19T20:58:57Z,renee@bizisblooming.com,"Hello! As I am reviewing the numbers for Chuck. I still have concerns. Just for California, in April I showed $9,493.71 was due based on taxes charged and collected as they are Cash Basis, not accrual as per the balance sheet. You made a tax payment of $2428. In May, there was another $3,547.25 tax collected bringing the current total balance of $13040.96 due, for the remainder of April and May taxes collected. Your recent report shows just over $11.2k due for May alone. When Zamp was hired, part of the agreement I believed was making sure Quickbooks was charging and collecting taxes appropriately and everything was flowing properly. There are taxes on the books for other states, so are those being incorrectly charged or not being filed/paid? Bloom originally invited Zamp to be an accountant user in February 2025. This invitation was not accepted and another was sent yesterday which was accepted. Something is still not right which leads me to believe the taxes on invoices are perhaps not correct? Please follow up with Chuck and verify with him that the correct taxes are being charged and collected. Your reports should always match (maybe off a few pennies) what the balance sheet shows. As he receives payments in Quickbooks, it allocates the portion to sales and tax based on his invoices. Thank you! -- Renee Lindsey Director of Client Services, Bloom Accounting Solutions Phone: (480) 734-5088"

Our accounting team has been reviewing the transaction list and trying to reconcile it against what we see in Zamp and QuickBooks, and I wanted to share a few findings to get your thoughts. Two invoices (SS15043 & SS14457) are missing entirely from the transaction list. The Zamp export totals $88,499.49, but a large chunk of that is made up of what look like duplicate entries. When we remove all the duplicates, the total drops to $28,841.50. Zamp, however, shows a collected total of $31,350.90, so we're seeing a $2,500 discrepancy. We have also cross-checked against our NY QuickBooks account. Everything marked in green on the sheet has been matched. The items in red are missing from Zamp, and it's just those two invoices mentioned above. Would you mind taking a look and letting us know how Zamp is calculating the $31,350.90 total?

On the nexus page, the data is different and I explained this is by design (different date ranges, the 'met on' date is frozen, but other amounts might update, etc.) Becky shared the liability report last week and we talked through it in this call, I noted that it's a general amount from the 1st of the month forward, and includes Amazon amounts, which would be excluded when calculating tax and the actual amount due. A separate issue: They are seeing tax calculated on order-level (partial) refunds in BigCommerce, even though they don't have nexus in any states and do not have tax calculations enabled. They're processing these refunds through their payment processor, Stripe, but that refund doesn't sync back to BigCommerce. David would like me to let him know once a fix is released for this, as this is something that was on Blayzer's radar, and Indisea will likely be diving in to fix. Similar tax calc issues on refunds with no tax: Eddins: https://secure.helpscout.net/conversation/2983110551/150651#thread-9077233924 Relisation Par: https://secure.helpscout.net/conversation/2971052446/146645#thread-9185074251 I think the solution here is to actually disable the BigCommerce fallback (10%) rates. I forgot about that (see the Realisation Par ticket above.)"
2974023447,147976,9273761254,message,2025-08-22T23:46:42Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi David, Following up with an update as we head into the weekend. First, I'd like to note that we're happy to talk about this on a call, and one can be scheduled with Becky and me using this link . So that you know, Zamp's system for sales tax filings and economic nexus analysis will adjust for each state's time zone. This is how Zamp was designed from the beginning, as it was determined to be the most technically legal and accurate approach by our Tax Research Team. This means that for RI, we'll automatically adjust for the EST time zone based on the date and time included with a transaction. For WA or CA, we'd use PST. For IL or KS, we'd use CST. We'll also adjust for AK and HI time zones. We do have some feature improvements in discovery and planning that could allow options to utilize a single time zone for filing. However, I'm unsure if we know that it would affect economic nexus analysis just yet. While digging into the data and reviewing the code and database tables involved in Zamp's Economic Nexus logic, I found a few items that affect\ the sales data used here that are important: Zamp's Economic Nexus Analysis tool looks at a varying set of data ranges per state, depending on the state's rules and legal code. E.g., for Alabama, we'll look at all of 2023, 2024, or 2025 as a version of the calendar or the Current Year . For Connecticut, it becomes tricky as we look at a "" rolling 12 months "" that ends on a specific month-end date: We look at 12 months ending at 12/31/23-12/31/25 , currently. For Illinois, we look at a rolling 4 quarters ending in date ranges from 12/31/23-12/31/25. There are other variations of this. In addition to the above, our Economic Nexus Analysis tool will utilize the date range with the highest dollar amount or transaction count to ensure compliance, with conservative estimates. I've shared some examples below. Alabama: I've attached a file showing the transactions used in our analysis for AL. We're looking at all BigCommerce orders, excluding refunds, and excluding Amazon Transactions. The date range we're using is 1/1/2025-8/22/2025 (the 2025 current year) because it is the highest of 2023, 2024, and 2025. Regarding Rhode Island: I've attached a file of the Rhode Island transactions we're using to make this determination, and Zamp is utilizing the 2025 year data for this, noting that we see the threshold as being met on 6/28/25 (the count of transactions then was 201). Currently, the count of transactions is 287. This count should update tomorrow or within the next few days at the latest (it's currently at 255.) So that you know, RI excludes refund or ""free"" transactions but includes Marketplace Transactions (Amazon) in their thresholds. Regarding Washington: I've also attached a Washington file showing all of the transactions that Zamp is using to consider here, and Zamp is also utilizing the 2025 data. The threshold was met on 8/9/25 with 100,058.08 in sales (transaction ID INV-259461-shipping_253668-01 and older within the attached file). Currently, the dollar threshold would be at $108,384.08. In this scenario, Zamp is excluding refund transactions and ""free"" transactions. I hope this is helpful, and we're happy to look into additional states or talk on a call. Have a great weekend!"

We've had some unexpected delays again this month, but are continuing to work to resolve those. I will have a more detailed reply later today, but the potential liability report Becky shared is based on the transactions page. I will focus on Rhode Island and Washington, but also review the rest of the states again. We'll also involve our engineering team, depending on the findings and how much progress we make today."

I've written or called too many people by the wrong name; it happens. Yes—the data within Zamp also includes Amazon transactions. I'm reviewing these categories and situations further, and will follow up as soon as I can. (Likely early next week.) Sounds good regarding the risk analysis, and we'll do what we can to figure out the puzzle here as well."

Our internal data combines Amazon with store sales to give a full picture. Here's a file that I created to compare our estimates with your data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v7stmslFqIIsHJtzjW_OGqb6KnLrZeu5zEWLBFq00rM/edit?usp=sharing The data is quite off. We have a few categories: 1. Both, our internal estimate as well as your data is over the threshold (this is for majority of the states) a. If we choose to register only going forward we don't have to resolve this b. If we choose to pay the sales tax backwards we'd need to dig deeper here 2. Both, our internal estimate as well as your data is below the threshold Luckily here the data more or less matches. There will have to be a decision made about when to register once one of the data points reaches the threshold. 3. One data point is over the threshold and the other one is under the threshold This happens only for Rhode Island and Washington. For now I'm waiting for Becky with the risk analysis. Once I review that I'll know more if we need to look deeper into the discrepancies. Best, David"

I'll dig into this more too. I updated the shipping address. I'll keep this up to date as we'll be transitioning to a new warehouse soon. According to our Tax Research Team's recently updated deep-dive research into every state's rules for economic nexus thresholds, refund transactions are excluded from the economic nexus thresholds, and all states' thresholds are based upon the gross sales (which include shipping). We have around 5% of returns on average. I don't think that would make the difference. Many states also have varying exclusions tied to resale/wholesale transactions, marketplace transactions, tax-exempt physical items, specific services, or tax-exempt services. I don't believe a lot of these would apply to XSTANCE here, based on my understanding of the product(s). No we don't have any wholesale Zamp's Economic Nexus Analysis also displays the dollar threshold amount and transaction account for whichever date range was the largest. Meaning, for a period of ' Previous or current calendar year' , we would look at either 1/1/24-12/31/24 or 1/1/24-7/31/24. That's ok and I matched our records to that as well. When we do make any changes, should we exclude any transactions from any of the Channel Names or sources noted in the BigCommerce export? We have to keep all the channels. They're all for US orders. The same for the sources, all sources should be included. Best, David"

I was writing up a follow-up as your email came in, and below are the items I wanted to follow up about. I'll share my thoughts about investigating the differences here, below those items. First, please note that we've imported the July 2025 Transactions from your BigCommerce Store, and from now on (from today), the transactions will sync automatically. An important step: While reviewing your BigCommerce store further, I noticed a message below on the tax settings page, indicating that an address within your BigCommerce store would need to be added for Zamp to calculate taxes (once that is enabled after registering in your nexus states). This address can be added under Settings —> Shipping —> the Shipping Origin section here, and BigCommerce shares more details about this setting in this article . Regarding the economic nexus thresholds and differences when compared against internal records for revenue: These differences are interesting to hear, especially for Illinois and Minnesota. I will need to dig into those situations further starting tomorrow, and I hope to have an update by Monday. A few items to consider with Zamp's Nexus Analysis: According to our Tax Research Team's recently updated deep-dive research into every state's rules for economic nexus thresholds, refund transactions are excluded from the economic nexus thresholds, and all states' thresholds are based upon the gross sales (which include shipping ). The date range for evaluating economic nexus thresholds varies by state, and we share more details about that in this article . I'll dive into the date ranges associated with the states noted, and confirm what we're using here. Many states also have varying exclusions tied to resale/wholesale transactions, marketplace transactions, tax-exempt physical items, specific services, or tax-exempt services. I don't believe a lot of these would apply to XSTANCE here, based on my understanding of the product(s). Zamp's Economic Nexus Analysis also displays the dollar threshold amount and transaction account for whichever date range was the largest. Meaning, for a period of ' Previous or current calendar year' , we would look at either 1/1/24-12/31/24 or 1/1/24-7/31/24. We'll start our investigation and gather as much information as possible about the situation before making any changes. One question I thought of: When we do make any changes, should we exclude any transactions from any of the Channel Names or sources noted in the BigCommerce export? Here's what we see after filtering the data to US Transactions:"

For the period of July 24 - June 25 it's around 226k Minnesota - 120k for July 24 - June 25 North Carolina - 83k for the past year Texas - 437k for July 24 - June 25 I'm attaching the link to our calculations: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1udjQTrD8ugcFYxbysH8WL124aPLa7Fqg/view?usp=drive_web (the first tab is for the UK company sales, the second one for the US sales which we are considering for the sales tax) I think it's better if I talk to Becky first and figure out the approach before we change anything.

The majority of XSTANCE's historical BigCommerce data (from March 2024 through June 2025) has been imported. We found some BigCommerce transactions from June 2025 and throughout 2024 that had invalid zip codes. We fixed those, and the last 131 of those transactions are importing right now. This should be completed tonight. Some questions here: Now that we have most of this data imported, would you like us to enable Zamp for calculations and transaction reporting within the XSTANCE BigCommerce store? We can enable either of these separately, and I just wanted to be sure we had your OK to proceed before making any changes. This is where I would enable it for the Zamp app : And this is the setting we would also need to change within your BigCommerce store's tax settings : We also share more details in this article and this article .

We spent some extra time validating the data and correcting some zip code and address errors (we understand that these issues can occur from time to time, especially with a system like GameFound). The tax-due estimate matches the tax collected in the GameFound exports Sean shared, and the totals also match. I've attached an export from the Zamp account's transactions, and it includes tax totals summed by state. Just to let you know, we're including a transaction from April 2025, shipped to VA, in the May 2025 filing, according to my conversation with Sean last month."

Agreed—we can sort out these adjustments, and we will also typically have a review period of 3 business days after the initial tax-due estimate is sent.

I will follow up in our other email thread with some additional questions to make sure we have all of the necessary information to make the call productive. So that you know, we released the filings earlier to ensure timely filing as we were approaching the end of the day here in the US, and while comparing refund transactions, everything looked aligned. The filing was submitted to TX already. That said, we're digging into this further and I'll have some follow-up questions in our other email thread to ensure we're on the same page. We'll sort this out and find the best resolution path. This will likely mean bringing July 2025 transactions into the August 2025 filing period to ensure the correct tax amount is remitted to the state."

I've escalated this directly to the head of one of our teams involved with the integrations side of Zamp. While I don't yet have an exact timeline, we're looking at 1-2 months to improve this. I hope to have a more concrete timeline and details to share by the middle of next week (around 8/27/25). For now, our recommendation would be to issue whole order refunds or item-level refunds. If an order-level partial refund is necessary, please let us know, and we can work together to find the best interim solution. We can also schedule a call using this link. I'm also about to send Realisation Par's tax-due estimate out for Texas, and we'd love to have approval or questions about that filing by the end of the day today , if possible, to ensure timely filing. I completed a review of your Texas transactions, and everything should line up as I didn't find any refunds where the tax wasn't fully refunded (most were full refunds). Please let us know if you have any questions."

Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Aksel, You're welcome! The tax-due estimate went out yesterday afternoon, around 4:24 PM EST. {#HS:2969188151-146357#} Sounds good all around, thanks! Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Aksel, You're welcome! I did have a nice holiday weekend; thanks! I hope your weekend was a nice one as well! 1. I just uploaded the CSV for August transactions - could you confirm that this will be taken into account for this upcoming filing cycle? Great! We received the file, and I'm working to get that data into Zamp right now. We should have a tax-due estimate heading your way with the Zoey data included by the end of the day. 2. I happened to see the task in Scope after logging in (I have a reminder on my end to check) but did not receive an email notification about the new task in there, so just a heads up. I'm not sure if I was supposed to receive a notification. This is interesting to hear, and thanks for letting us know. An email notification about the task should have been sent. We'll look into this and follow up before the end of September to ensure the notification is sent for October. I will also have a separate email heading your way to introduce you to our contact at Scope <https://scope.cx/>, Yuri. {#HS:2969188151-146357#} Hi Chris, I hope you had a nice holiday weekend & thanks for the info below. I wanted to check in about a couple of things: 1. I just uploaded the CSV for August transactions - could you confirm that this will be taken into account for this upcoming filing cycle? 2. I happened to see the task in Scope after logging in (I have a reminder on my end to check) but did not receive an email notification about the new task in there, so just a heads up. I'm not sure if I was supposed to receive a notification. Thanks, Aksel Güngör Hi Aksel, You're welcome! Great; I'm glad we're all set here and we appreciate your collaboration and understanding throughout all of this. Out of curiosity, which project management tool have you decided to adopt? We're using a tool our Head of Customer Success found, called Scope <https://scope.cx/>, and it's been wonderful so far! Yes—we have Zamp branding implemented. Have a great week! Thanks Chris. I received the invitation so I think we're all set there and sounds good about ensuring the csv doesn't get missed going forward. Out of curiosity, which project management tool have you decided to adopt? I can't make out whose it is when logged in. Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, You're welcome! *1) *Good to know, and thanks for your patience with this. I realized that I missed a step in the invite process, and I sent the project management tool invitation (clients.zamp.com) out a few minutes ago. *2)* Yes, we'll include the CSV data in the filings for Illinois and Virginia. Before we had realized what had happened here, Georgia and Pennsylvania had already been filed. - I will bring the GA and PA transactions into August 2025 to ensure the tax is remitted to the states. - I'm also putting some additional checks and balances into the process to ensure this doesn't happen again. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you do not receive the project management tool invitation. Thanks Chris. 1. I didn't receive an invitation, just a heads up. To confirm, did you send it to aksel@ficksmusic.com? (Nothing in my spam folder) 2. Thanks. Also to confirm this point, the csv info will be included in this most recent filing? Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Aksel, You're welcome! 1. I received the invitation to join the account, does this mean I now also have access to the project management tool at clients.zamp.com? No—this is a separate invite and I forgot to include that invite for you. I've sent this invite out to you as of a few minutes ago. 2. I saw the 8/5 ""Review & approve filings"" email come through, could you confirm that the CSV that was uploaded via the project management tool was taken into consideration and used as part of the latest filing/calculations? No—it looks like this CSV file wasn't included, and I'll sync with the folks who worked on this to ensure it's not missed in the future. I'll work on importing this data and confirm with you here once it's completed (likely tomorrow morning). Thanks for your help with this, Chris. Just a couple of follow-up questions: 1. I received the invitation to join the account, does this mean I now also have access to the project management tool at clients.zamp.com? 2. I saw the 8/5 ""Review & approve filings"" email come through, could you confirm that the CSV that was uploaded via the project management tool was taken into consideration and used as part of the latest filing/calculations? Thanks again, Aksel Hi David, You're welcome; glad we could help here! I understand and would likely take the same path if I were in a similar situation. I've updated items on our end to ensure Zamp-related emails will go to Aksel for filing or data-related items, and Zamp account-related items. I've also unsubscribed you from these emails on our end. That said, and if you do receive an email from Zamp after today, there should be a quick unsubscribe option at the bottom of our emails. Have a great evening! wrote: Hi Chris, No worries! We're both admins with transparency, so we're not concerned about that. Mainly, I'm trying to remove any noise that Aksel is handling from my inbox. So, if there's any easy unsubscribe that I can do (or you can do for me) that would be ideal. That way my user login stays active should I ever need to log in. So, basically option 2. And thank you for being so conscientious about this! Best regards, David Hi David and Aksel, Thanks again for being so patient! I just sent out the Zamp user invite to aksel@ficksmusic.com. Please note that Zamp doesn't have a concept of account admins currently, and everyone would have the same access. David—to confirm, would you like us to remove you from Zamp's emails, remove your Zamp user (which would remove all Zamp access), or both? - I'm just being cautious here and confirming, in case it wasn't clear that this would mean losing Zamp access. - We do have ""unsubscribe"" options in our emails, and I could separately remove you from our filing and csv/data-reminder focused emails.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, The state totals I sent over was an export from our system. I attached a filtered CSV from the original file you sent over showing the tax total.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states.

Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Askel, Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team jumping in! Thank you for the follow-up and for providing this data. *1)* OK, noted, and this makes sense to us. *2)* Normally, we would be able to include these additional orders in the tax calculations for the most recent reporting cycle, with filings due this month, July 2025. As of today (7/7/25), Ficks Music's sales tax filings, due this month, have been released. We didn't hear back before the deadline noted in the email, Thursday, 7/3/25, which was sent out on 7/1/25. - Meaning—the sales tax filings are already being processed and are in varying stages of submission to the various US states.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states. This way, we're all consistently on the same page, and it ensures we have all the data across all states, regardless of nexus status or filing schedule.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red.

Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31.

We could handle this in a similar way to how we'd recommend handling the May 2025 transactions. *Question*—Are you OK with us including these transactions in the July 2025 filing period *3)* For the May 2025 transactions, we can include them along with the June 2025 transactions in the reporting and filing period processed for July 2025 in August 2025. *4)* Yes, that works for us! We recommend including all July 2025 transactions across all states, as this can help ensure that transactions from states that are filed quarterly or semi-annually are not missed. *Question*—Does that work for you and make sense in this context? -- Chris Ralph support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] < https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform&gt ; Hi Nick, As a follow-up to the thread below, attached are the exported orders for the following period: *January 1 - June 30* 1. You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us. I appreciate your diligence and patience, and I am happy to try and answer any other questions. -- Nick Kondak support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] < https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform&gt ; Hi Nick, - If order # SO1100000219 in row 19 was a regular order (not a refunded one) then the tax amount would be $7.01 - This would mean that the total, overall tax amount would be $87.48 across all orders on the spreadsheet - Since order # SO1100000219 was cancelled and refunded, it's as if it never happened, and so we can simulate this by simply removing that order from the spreadsheet. In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, The state totals I sent over was an export from our system. I attached a filtered CSV from the original file you sent over showing the tax total. For this example, I removed the repeated the line item transactions and summed the transaction tax total which we use, not the line item tax amount. -- Nick Kondak support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] < https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform&gt ; Hi Nick, Thanks for the follow-up. Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, You're welcome! I did have a nice holiday weekend; thanks! I hope your weekend was a nice one as well! 1. I just uploaded the CSV for August transactions - could you confirm that this will be taken into account for this upcoming filing cycle? Great! We received the file, and I'm working to get that data into Zamp right now. We should have a tax-due estimate heading your way with the Zoey data included by the end of the day. 2. I happened to see the task in Scope after logging in (I have a reminder on my end to check) but did not receive an email notification about the new task in there, so just a heads up. I'm not sure if I was supposed to receive a notification. This is interesting to hear, and thanks for letting us know. An email notification about the task should have been sent. We'll look into this and follow up before the end of September to ensure the notification is sent for October. I will also have a separate email heading your way to introduce you to our contact at Scope <https://scope.cx/>, Yuri. Hi Chris, I hope you had a nice holiday weekend & thanks for the info below.

I've updated items on our end to ensure Zamp-related emails will go to Aksel for filing or data-related items, and Zamp account-related items. I've also unsubscribed you from these emails on our end. That said, and if you do receive an email from Zamp after today, there should be a quick unsubscribe option at the bottom of our emails. Have a great evening! wrote: Hi Chris, No worries! We're both admins with transparency, so we're not concerned about that. Mainly, I'm trying to remove any noise that Aksel is handling from my inbox. So, if there's any easy unsubscribe that I can do (or you can do for me) that would be ideal. That way my user login stays active should I ever need to log in. So, basically option 2. And thank you for being so conscientious about this! Best regards, David Hi David and Aksel, Thanks again for being so patient! I just sent out the Zamp user invite to aksel@ficksmusic.com. Please note that Zamp doesn't have a concept of account admins currently, and everyone would have the same access. David—to confirm, would you like us to remove you from Zamp's emails, remove your Zamp user (which would remove all Zamp access), or both? - I'm just being cautious here and confirming, in case it wasn't clear that this would mean losing Zamp access. - We do have ""unsubscribe"" options in our emails, and I could separately remove you from our filing and csv/data-reminder focused emails.

Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states. This way, we're all consistently on the same page, and it ensures we have all the data across all states, regardless of nexus status or filing schedule.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows.

We'll continue with the monthly exports and look forward to truing up the numbers during the next filing period. Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us. I appreciate your diligence and patience, and I am happy to try and answer any other questions. -- Nick Kondak support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] < https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform&gt ; Hi Nick, - If order # SO1100000219 in row 19 was a regular order (not a refunded one) then the tax amount would be $7.01 - This would mean that the total, overall tax amount would be $87.48 across all orders on the spreadsheet - Since order # SO1100000219 was cancelled and refunded, it's as if it never happened, and so we can simulate this by simply removing that order from the spreadsheet. In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, The state totals I sent over was an export from our system. I attached a filtered CSV from the original file you sent over showing the tax total.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states. This way, we're all consistently on the same page, and it ensures we have all the data across all states, regardless of nexus status or filing schedule.

Best, Aksel Güngör Hi Askel, Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team jumping in! Thank you for the follow-up and for providing this data. *1)* OK, noted, and this makes sense to us. *2)* Normally, we would be able to include these additional orders in the tax calculations for the most recent reporting cycle, with filings due this month, July 2025. As of today (7/7/25), Ficks Music's sales tax filings, due this month, have been released. We didn't hear back before the deadline noted in the email, Thursday, 7/3/25, which was sent out on 7/1/25. - Meaning—the sales tax filings are already being processed and are in varying stages of submission to the various US states. We could handle this in a similar way to how we'd recommend handling the May 2025 transactions. *Question*—Are you OK with us including these transactions in the July 2025 filing period *3)* For the May 2025 transactions, we can include them along with the June 2025 transactions in the reporting and filing period processed for July 2025 in August 2025. *4)* Yes, that works for us! We recommend including all July 2025 transactions across all states, as this can help ensure that transactions from states that are filed quarterly or semi-annually are not missed. *Question*—Does that work for you and make sense in this context? -- Chris Ralph support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] < https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform&gt ; Hi Nick, As a follow-up to the thread below, attached are the exported orders for the following period: *January 1 - June 30* 1. You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us. I appreciate your diligence and patience, and I am happy to try and answer any other questions. -- Nick Kondak support@zamp.com P: (866) 438-9267 [image: Zamp%20Customer%20Referral%20Email%20Header.png] < https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeAmX5uuBIu03wbmUGsWebsgLa-hyD_YKj-tmItm1o6pYAIA/viewform&gt ; Hi Nick, - If order # SO1100000219 in row 19 was a regular order (not a refunded one) then the tax amount would be $7.01 - This would mean that the total, overall tax amount would be $87.48 across all orders on the spreadsheet - Since order # SO1100000219 was cancelled and refunded, it's as if it never happened, and so we can simulate this by simply removing that order from the spreadsheet. In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules? Yes—the monthly reports across all states will be sufficient, and we will not need a separate and additional quarterly or semi-annual export of orders for any of those states.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel"

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount. Could you explain the logic behind the tax amount of $7.01 being a negative number and not simply 0'ed out by the refund we issued on our end when we cancelled the order?

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46.

I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed. Just to clarify, will the monthly reports across all states be enough or will you also need us to send a separate and additional quarterly/semi-annual export of orders for those respective states on non-monthly filing schedules?

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be > good to include in future transactions list sent to us. I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel Hi Askel, You're welcome! Great! We'll bring these transactions forward into the July 2025 filing period(s) next week, and one of us will follow up once that has been completed.

The estimate includes the adjustments per our usual process, and I've attached the files associated with that adjustment: The Export from Shopify with the adjustment work. The adjustment file I imported into Zamp to make those adjustments. We've completed adjusting for nearly all of the February 2025 refunds, except for ~$8.95 in tax for California. I've also attached an export from Zamp along with a comparison to the tax-due estimate. An item to note: There are some refunds for Colorado, causing a decent variance (as happened with TN, IL, VA, and CA in February.) Would you like us to adjust for this variance in the July 2025 filing? This should be doable as it's a larger sales tax month, depending on CO sales. If so, we'll remove the transaction causing this difference, and that will lower the tax-due estimate for CO."

Shopify must have taken some time to update the permissions, which happens occasionally. 1) is that the one you usually use to download? Yep! That's the user I will have access to as it's the owner of our Shopify Partner account. 2) Regarding the download: The export file will likely take anywhere from 30 minutes up to a few hours to export. Shopify's exports are sent via email after processing, which can take some time for larger order volumes. The good news is that I've been able to request the download, and you won't ned to send it over to us here. Thanks for working with us on this! I'll have a tax-due estimate sent out today along with the usual supporting documentation. :)"

This scenario makes sense to me as we've been working through various versions of permission-related items over the last month (or more) with other clients (in addition to some Shopify reporting changes). Can you try again and see if its working now for you? I just logged out and back in, but I still do not have the order export permissions. I'll give it a few hours and see if the order export option appears, as I know some Google services (GCP and Firebase) are experiencing a worldwide outage, which has affected Shopify as well. There could still be delays related to this as various systems are recovering or pivoting. ""Order fix View - Zamp"" --- do you only need it filtered for May 2025 only? Yep, we only need it filtered for May 2025 only because we've been adjusting based on the previous month, each time we make these adjustments (so that nothing falls through the cracks.) An update I forgot to share, related to these adjustments: Our engineering team has begun work on improvements to better handle Shopify voided and canceled orders. Once this is complete, we should only need to adjust for edited orders in the future. Our team is also revisiting the edited order situations while using a few solutions we (Technical Success) have come up with to solve for them. This doesn't mean we'll have a solution in the future, but multiple improvements are either in progress or being revisited in a discovery phase."

If necessary, the file could be uploaded to this secure location. This will help expedite the current filing process, as we aim to have Ravella's filings released by the end of the day on Monday (6/16/25) or as soon as possible.

This is happening because of a large refund in Illinois, which was processed on May 14, 2025, but was associated with a transaction from April 26, 2025 (Order ID #1933). This refund includes a total of $201.77 in tax that was refunded, and the Illinois jurisdiction associated with it reported $0 in sales for May 2025. The specific jurisdiction involved is CHICAGO CITY (COOK COUNTY). The reason this happens is that Illinois does not permit negative tax balances on its filings for local jurisdictions, such as Chicago. When this happens, Zamp reduces the filing for that jurisdiction to $0 (or, in this case, leaves it at $0). Would you like us to track this transaction and roll it forward in a future filing period if there are future sales to Chicago, IL, that will allow this refund to be accounted for?"

The Arizona, Louisiana, South Carolina, and West Virginia amounts are in line with the amounts Belva shared earlier this month.

It's partially due to the corrections, which total approximately $10,450.09 for the May 2025 filing period in states where SIGMA files monthly (many are quarterly, while some are annual). Overall, this amount aligns with the total tax collected, as seen in the BigCommerce May 2025 transactions and May 2025 QuickBooks Online sales data import. This combined total for May 2025 (excluding NY, see the details below) is approximately $146,385.70.

We're still keeping an eye on the Minnesota report and associated filing to see if this tax refund can be accounted for in the MN Q2 2025 filing. The transaction falls into St. Paul, MN, which has a local jurisdiction tax attributed to RAMSEY COUNTY TRANSIT, and that rate is 0.5%. Right now, the tax associated with this refund would be approximately $35.65, and the current tax within that jurisdiction is $14. This means that we may need to move the refund to Q3 2025 to account for MN.

In this situation, we should be able to account for it in the June 2025 filing period for Minnesota as long as there is enough tax collected to cover the $395.28 amount. The reason for that is that the various states do not allow negative local jurisdiction balances on their filings. After briefly reviewing the MN Q2 2025 data, we may be able to account for this credit, depending on the amount of sales bucketed into Ramsey County, MN, once it's time to file that return. Currently, the sales volume in this county is $2,763, with a tax of $14. Otherwise, the transaction would need to be moved forward until it can be accounted for. I can investigate this further by Tuesday and will follow up with the results or any additional findings. What is the best way to approach these adjustments? What do you need from me to report voided invoices? I believe we'd want a credit memo created in QuickBooks Online, referencing the invoice that was voided by it, for this purpose. If we want to track it there, we can create one. Alternatively, we can adjust within Zamp once we've validated that there is enough sales tax in the associated local jurisdiction."

One of our employees voided an invoice today from 11/26/2024. Invoice 9007, which was already included in our sales tax report as it's reported before the customer has paid. Unfortunately, this was an invoice before we fixed the ""location of sale"" issue popping up with QBO invoices and calculation of sales tax. So this should have been MN sales tax but was recorded as Arizona sales tax. That being said, rather than adjusting that prior liability to zero now, will it work to leave that as a liability debit on the books for now, and offset our June report for Minnesota with a $395.28 credit? That way I can make an accurate real time adjustment vs a retroactive one. What is the best way to approach these adjustments? What do you need from me to report voided invoices?

For the future, what we need on our end is to know what transaction you are eliminating from your system so we can also pull that transaction and reclass it. We would need to know the Transaction ID and preferably the Total sales and the total tax amount so we can make sure we match. When the total tax did not match on that transaction to the total tax that we had in our system, that is why we questioned whether the line had the wrong transaction ID or if the line had the wrong tax amount listed. Also two of the jurisdiction names did not match from our system. We will pull the transaction from our count and will reclass it. Saman, it is okay to go in and approve Leadwork now. Thank you!"

I should have clarified in my previous email that the negative amount shown in the new Report/Export I shared represents the tax-due estimate amount that has become negative within the specified local jurisdiction, rather than the transaction's entire refund amount. Meaning—this amount is just the jurisdiction's balance becoming negative, not the full refunded tax amount for each transaction. The amounts are also broken up by jurisdiction for the transaction in question. Within Zamp, we have this transaction imported with the total tax amount as -$10.71 : In the future, I'll exclude that detail if it's preferable, and the initial goal was to illustrate the cause of the difference as negative local jurisdiction balances (while omitting a full explanation). Does the above make sense to you, and do you have any questions?"

As discussed during our call on Friday, we confirmed that the timezone issue didn't affect the 2022-2024 historical data that was imported in February 2025; it was also recalculated for overdue filings in April 2025. We also reviewed the following months for Connecticut and found the causes noted below. The June 2025 CT tax-due estimate was higher due to a timezone issue. There were 23 CT Transactions with $11.53 in tax collected that were moved into June, in addition to the June 2025 transactions. The June file had $163.26 in tax collection. The combined total was $174.80 , which becomes $175.00 when applying Connecticut's rounding rules for their filings. The May 2025 tax-due estimate and tax remitted were lower due to the timezone issue. This amount was $156.75 in tax collected, which becomes $164.00 when applying CT's rounding rules for their filings. The April 2025 does appear to have been affected by the timezone issue. We're currently working on the January through April 2025 data to determine if and which transactions were also affected by this timezone issue. Once we've confirmed this, we'll update the data, share the results, and ensure that any transactions in states where Q2 2025 filings were already processed are moved forward, as we did with the May 2025 transactions. I've attached two files: a June XLSX file with tax totals by state and another XLSX file showing the May 2025 transactions that were moved into June 2025. This will help us all ensure we're on the same page. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Both Jen and Persha were OK with us doing that. Separate issue: For CT 2023 Transactions, focusing on January 2023, the following details apply. They're seeing 7.35% in tax collected in their file for Sauce Transactions. Why does the tax liability and transaction page not match? This is happening because the SaaS/subscription transactions had $0 tax and needed to be recalculated, so the liability page and transactions page won't match there. Still, the gross sales should be higher for January 2023 for Connecticut, and likely other states as well. Even by the files that Nick shared here, it should be much higher. Jen estimated a bit over $300, while the file Nick shared showed $198 just in subscription revenue. We need to triple-check the amounts and see if a file just needs to be reimported. https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cm34x4f5o01qn14lgi27uxuk8/customer-reports/liability?monthRange=2023-01~2023-01 https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cm34x4f5o01qn14lgi27uxuk8/transactions?shipToState=CT&date=2023-01-01%7E2023-01-31&limit=50 We need to: See why the gross sales are low - likely the timezone issue that we ran into for May 2025. Perhaps transactions weren't included, although they were imported, and this is related to a broader issue we've observed. We'll likely need to compare the original source files to data within Zamp."

We've successfully created the offset (refund) transactions to account for the tax that was already remitted to the state of New York for these two deleted orders. This means that the $7.75 tax refund will be included in your upcoming Q2 2025 NY filing to be filed in September 2025 (covering the date range of 6/1/25-8/31/25). Zamp files sales tax returns net of any returns or refunds, meaning those transactions ""offset"" or recover taxes that were either not charged to the customer or refunded to the customer. Here's what these transactions look like within Zamp: Please let us know if you have any questions. Have an excellent rest of your week!"

Yes—we've confirmed that the New York Q1 2025 filing had already been processed (on June 9, 2025) when the update was made for these transactions, which means that this change was not accounted for. This means that our approach to resolving this situation will need to change, and I'll share those steps below. We would need to know the dollar amounts associated with these transactions, as they have already been deleted from Zamp. We can manually create refund Transactions associated with the two Transaction IDs noted below, dated June 15, 2025. This will then ensure the tax is refunded to the Wayo when Zamp files the NY Q2 2025 return in September 2025.

This is interesting to hear because, within Zamp, we see a significantly higher amount of sales tax collected and paid for Illinois. Within Zamp, we see $1,110.12 in tax collected in IL. Zamp's tax-due estimate was $1,095.00, which included a $20 timely filing discount (also known as the 'Retailer's discount'). This may be related to something separate from Zamp within QuickBooks Online or another item. Was this regarding the Illinois May 2025 filing period or a different period?"

We can help investigate this, hopefully by the end of the week or early next week at the latest. The differences here are likely related to a few items: Slight differences in calculations between Zamp and the state's filing portal (we try our best, but there can be differences here/there). Additional transactions synced to Zamp between when the tax-due estimate is generated and when our filing team processes the filings. This would be my initial guess, but I will need to review the database to confirm when various transactions are created within the Zamp database. Once we know more, we'll follow up right away!"

Looks much better this month! Thanks for cleaning it up. I have approved.

Question, I am seeing quite a variance with what was filed and what was pulled from our account. Can you please have a look at the April Tab in the attached workbook: Column Q if what was filed Column U is what was pulled from our account Are you able to help me understand why there are variances? We are going to assess this every month going forward.

Thank you,

We looked into this further and confirmed that the majority of the Connecticut tax-due estimate difference was related to missing the in-person Shopify POS Transactions. I also believe we've found the cause of this, and I'll share more details below. The other variances appear to be due to rounding, timely filing discounts (where Zamp's estimate is lower), and potentially time zone differences. We've manually imported those transactions for this month, and here's an updated tax-due estimate: State code Period Estimated sales tax AR May 2025 $57.00 CT May 2025 $1,080.00 GA May 2025 $244.31 IL May 2025 $622.00 KY May 2025 $119.07 MD May 2025 $191.41 MA May 2025 $545.89 MI May 2025 $290.93 NE May 2025 $56.70 NC May 2025 $498.03 OH May 2025 $511.97 RI May 2025 $47.14 UT May 2025 $69.81 VT May 2025 $81.03 VA May 2025 $266.49 WV May 2025 $55.25 Combined Total: $4,737.03 Question —do we now have your approval to proceed with Select Seeds' filings this month? We aim to have these moving along by the end of today, but we can hold them a bit, until the end of the day on Monday (6/16/25). The goal here is to ensure timely filing by the states' due dates. The cause of this: This issue occurred because the Zamp Shopify integration's access to your Shopify store is missing the "" read_location "" permission, a newer requirement that Shopify recently introduced. Specifically, it allows us to view the POS locations and associate those addresses with the transactions in Zamp. This permission can be added by going to: Settings —> Apps and sales channels —> click ""Develop Apps"" (in the top right) —> Zamp —> Configuration within your Shopify Admin. Then, click the ""Edit"" button next to ""Admin API integration."" Search for ""locations"" and add "" read_locations "" by checking the box. Click the black ""Save"" button. This was an item we reviewed in all Zamp customers' Shopify stores, but it was missed because there weren't POS Location sales for us to import from Select Seeds until May 2025. I'm also happy to hop on a cal l to walk through the above. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I do not see where these values are broken down on the CSV, so I am unsure where / how to enter. In this situation, the sales tax would be placed in the transactionTax column within the CSV template. At this time, Zamp does not currently support importing transactions with business use tax on the cost of goods, as Zamp's product and services are geared towards sales and use tax collected from customers. If you're referring to sales and use tax (some states call ""sales tax"" a form of ""use tax"" for out-of-state businesses), then it would belong in the transactionTax column as well (combined with sales tax). I've connected with Caroline about the business use tax piece, and this is something that could be discussed further. However, if there was an installation charge or other charge, should this also be included in the total or broken out? Yes—if there is a charge for a service or product that is tax-exempt or potentially taxed differently in various states, we'd recommend breaking that out into a separate row (with the same transactionId) on the CSV template. Then, in the last column of the attached example template, place the applicable tax code in the lineItemProductTaxCode column (column Q in the attached CSV). Ultimately, the decision to break this out separately or not is up to you (or the Iron Lion Entries team). If the installation charges are not billed independently, they will be considered taxable along with the rest of the transaction. I am attempting to populate the CSV from our filed reports. Does the order of the columns in the CSV matter or must they stay in the represented positions with ""transactionId"" in the first column, etc.? Yes—the order of the columns within the CSV file needs to remain as it is because Zamp's system is designed to import the sales data with the file's columns in the exact order of our template.

During our call, we confirmed that the Transaction Sync (bulk/historical) to Zamp is still not functioning, despite clearing the Zamp-related Scheduled Actions and verifying that an order did not have a Zamp Transaction Sync Status of ""Successful"". Here's my Calendly link to schedule a call for next week or after if preferred: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min These are the options for clearing any Zamp Tax-related transaction sync records and effectively ""resetting"" these items: Utilizing the WP-CLI Command via WP-CLI access. This involves creating a file, similar to the attached wp-cli-zamp-reset.php , within the store's theme or a must-use plugin. Run it with the command wp zamp reset-sync . Run the below functions via functions.php - see the attached file. Run the below SQL queries in phpMyAdmin or a similar tool. 2) The functions to run: function reset_zamp_sync_data() {
if (!current_user_can('manage_woocommerce')) {
return 'Insufficient permissions';
}

// Clean up scheduled actions
if (class_exists('ActionScheduler')) {
as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch', array(), 'zamp-transactions-sync');
}

// Clean up options
global $wpdb;
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->options} WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_sync_%'"");
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->options} WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_transactions_queue_%'"");

// Reset sync status
update_option('zamp_sync_status', 'ready');

// Clear transaction status meta
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->postmeta} WHERE meta_key IN ('zamp_transaction_status', 'zamp_transaction_date', 'zamp_transaction_error')"");

return 'Zamp sync data has been completely reset';

// if (current_user_can('manage_woocommerce') && isset($_GET['reset_zamp_sync'])) {
// echo reset_zamp_sync_data();
// exit;
// }
// }); 3) The SQL queries: -- Clear scheduled actions
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_sync_%';
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_transactions_queue_%';

-- Reset sync status
INSERT INTO wp_options (option_name, option_value, autoload) 
VALUES ('zamp_sync_status', 'ready', 'yes') 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE option_value = 'ready';

-- Clear transaction status meta
DELETE FROM wp_postmeta 
WHERE meta_key IN ('zamp_transaction_status', 'zamp_transaction_date', 'zamp_transaction_error'); Overall, we're hoping to accomplish the following items somehow: Clean up scheduled actions via Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() Clear any scheduled events with wp_clear_scheduled_hook('zamp_process_transactions_event') Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() - Removes all scheduled batch processing tasks Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data() - Removes all sync progress and queue data from the options table"

2962054083,143046,9048895605,note,2025-06-18T17:52:07Z,chris@zamp.com,"Moving to pending ahead of the call. After reviewing the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin code looking at zamp-tax/includes/admin/transaction-sync/class-zamp-transaction-sync-batch.php , it appears this could be related to multiple items: The following is similar to situations we worked through at TaxJar for WooCommerce. We may need to involve Arlene Cycle's more technical team for database access, depending on what we find during our call today. Issues After Plugin Reinstallation Several things might cause transactions not to sync to Zamp after reinstallation: Orphaned Action Scheduler Tasks : The plugin uses WooCommerce Action Scheduler to queue batch processing tasks After reinstallation, old scheduled actions might still exist in the database, but the code to handle them might have changed These tasks are stored in the WordPress database in the wp_actionscheduler_actions table Stale Transaction Status Metadata : The plugin stores transaction status as post meta ( zamp_transaction_status ) If an order was previously marked as ""Success"", it won't be reprocessed by default After reinstallation, this metadata remains but the actual sync state might be different Incomplete Cleanup of Previous Sync Data : Batch progress data is stored in WordPress options with prefixes: zamp_transactions_queue_ for batch queues zamp_sync_progress_ for progress tracking If reinstallation happens during an active sync, these might remain in an inconsistent state Sync Status Inconsistency : The global sync status is stored in the zamp_sync_status option If this is stuck in 'in_progress' after reinstallation, new syncs might be blocked Clearing Caches and Resetting Queues To resolve these issues after reinstallation, you should: Clear Action Scheduler Queue : The plugin has a built-in method: Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() This calls as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch', array(), self::SCHEDULER_GROUP) You might need to manually trigger this if the reinstallation didn't properly clean up Clean Up Sync Data : Use Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data() to remove all sync progress and queue data This removes all options with prefixes zamp_sync_progress_ and zamp_transactions_queue_ Reset Sync Status : Set the sync status back to 'ready': Zamp_Transaction_Sync::set_sync_status('ready') This allows new syncs to be initiated Clear Transaction Status Metadata (if needed): If you want to force reprocessing of previously synced orders, you might need to clear the zamp_transaction_status post meta This would be a custom SQL query against the post meta table The most reliable approach would be to run a cleanup sequence that: Stops any in-progress syncs Clears all scheduled actions Removes all sync-related options Resets the sync status to 'ready' This would give you a clean slate to start syncing transactions again after reinstallation. —————————————————————————————————————————- 1. Zamp Plugin UI The Zamp plugin itself appears to provide some admin UI for transaction sync operations, but based on the code reviewed, there is no explicit UI button or menu for a full ""reset"" or ""cleanup"" of all sync data and scheduled actions. However: Stopping Sync: There is an AJAX action for stopping sync ( zamp_stop_transaction_sync ), which calls Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() and resets status. If the plugin’s admin UI provides a “Stop Sync” or “Cancel Sync” button, using it will clear scheduled actions and reset the sync status. Starting Sync: Starting a new sync ( zamp_start_transaction_sync ) also calls the cleanup method before creating new batches. So, starting a new sync from the UI should clear out old scheduled actions. No ""Full Reset"" Button: There is no evidence of a UI button to clear all progress, batch queues, or transaction meta in bulk. These are handled in the backend code. 2. WooCommerce Action Scheduler UI WooCommerce (and some plugins) provide an Action Scheduler admin screen at: WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Here, you can view, search, and manually run or delete scheduled actions, including those for Zamp (look for hooks like zamp_process_transactions_batch ). You can manually delete stuck or failed actions from this screen. 3. WordPress Options / Post Meta No UI for Options Table or Post Meta: WordPress does not provide a native UI to delete custom options (like zamp_sync_progress_* , zamp_transactions_queue_* ) or post meta ( zamp_transaction_status ). You would need a plugin like “WP-Optimize”, “Advanced DB Cleaner”, or direct database access for this. 4. Cache Plugins If you are using a caching plugin (e.g., WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache), you can clear the site cache from their UI, but this does not affect Action Scheduler or Zamp sync data. Summary Table What you can do from UI How/Where Stop/cancel sync Zamp plugin admin (if button exists) Start new sync (clears queue) Zamp plugin admin View/delete scheduled actions WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Clear transaction/post meta Not available in default UI Clear plugin options Not available in default UI Clear site cache Cache plugin UI (not related to Zamp sync) If you need a full reset: Use the Zamp UI to stop any running sync. Use the WooCommerce Scheduled Actions UI to delete any stuck Zamp-related actions. For a true “factory reset” (clearing all progress, queues, and post meta), you would need to run code or SQL, or add a custom admin tool."

I'll review the log file and delve further into the code associated with our WooCommerce plugin.

After reviewing the logs and conducting some research, I don't immediately see the cause of this issue, and we should schedule a call using this link for early next week (if you or the team are available). There are a few items we can review within a WooCommerce order to see what happened and why it didn't sync to Zamp. A call would also be helpful to hunt for details in WooCommerce's 'Scheduled Actions' queue in case something isn't happening there as it should. This is under WooCommerce —> Status —> Scheduled Actions. A few questions: 1) When you have a moment, could you please share a screenshot of what the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin shows when attempting to run a historical transaction sync ? I'm curious to see this message and if there's any history, log, or report available to download: However, the Historical Transaction Sync shows ""No sync activity report to load."" 2) If you try rerunning the historical transaction sync, do you see any log files that might be named 'zamp-transactions' or something similar? The logs will be under WooCommerce → Status → Logs and start with 'Zamp.' I'm also working with a colleague who helped build our WooCommerce plugin to sort this out. I'll follow up if there's anything else we need to ask! Have a great weekend!"

Calculations from Zamp aren't returning tax collected, even with Stripe Tax disabled. Notes from the call: Before Zamp, they were using Stripe Tax's plugin for WooCommerce. Taxes calculate fine with Stripe Tax, but they're listed as a different tax line from what Zamp would look for (state + jurisdiction name combination). They're also using WooCommerce Subscriptions. Zamp-specific steps: They had the correct API token for Zamp, but we replaced it and saved anyway. Nexus states are correctly configured in Zamp and Woo. Tax calcs and transaction sync were enabled. Debug mode was enabled today (6/6/25). Disabled Stripe Tax and placed an order with only Zamp Tax enabled, no tax was calculated. Re-enabled Stripe Tax, and the tax was calculated. They have the default PTC enabled. Addresses appear to be formatted fine. No transactions in Zamp are showing tax collected, although tax was collected. Example is TR-1348 shown in the screenshot below. Order ID TR-1348: The transaction sync from 6/3/25: Reviewing the logs: The 6/3/25 log file shows a bunch of 409/conflict errors, meaning the transaction already exists. There are a few subtotal, shipping, and tax errors, where issues with amounts may occur (but only in 5 out of 100+ orders). The 6/5/25 log file shows a bunch of attempts to start tax calculations, but the addresses only contain ""state"":""AZ"" The log files from today ( 6/6/25 ) appear to show successful tax calcs, but no taxes were shown on orders in Zamp, or test checkout orders (not entirely placed): Address for my test: 1395 S Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 85286 There's a 400 bad_request error at 2025-06-06T13:07:39+00:00 due to: Receiving lineItems and quantity as string values instead of numbers (I think?)

Q1 2025 is from 3/1/25 to 5/31/25, and is due in June 2025. We share more info about that here , and the NY DOR shares details here . In the Shopify Report here , the total tax collected is $12,616.72 , and Zamp's tax-due estimate is slightly lower (due to time zones, most likely) at $12,606.10 .

I've looked at May's numbers and most look good, WA looks a bit high in zapped, could you help us check here? Sure! The difference in Zamp's tax-due estimate for Washington versus Shopify is caused by the Washington Business & Occupation (B&O) tax , which is a gross receipts tax that businesses pay to the state on gross sales to customers located within Washington. This is a tax that is not typically collected from customers but is required to be paid when filing WA sales tax returns. The Shopify United States Sales Tax Report shows $3,384.16 in tax collected. The breakdown of the B&O tax is: Retailing - Gross Amount: $38,972.09 - Tax Rate: 0.471% - Tax estimated due: $183.56 . Wholesaling - Gross Amount: $9,693.87 - Tax Rate: 0.484% - Tax Due: $46.92 . Combined B&O total : $230.48 The combined total of tax collected and the B&O tax matches Zamp's tax-due estimate ($ 3,609.77 ) within a few dollars (lower): $3,614.64 .

I've attached an XLSX file showing a comparison between Zamp's tax-due estimate and Shopify's United States Sales Tax Reports (links to those reports, below). The Shopify United States Sales Tax Report filtered to New York for the NY Q1 2025 period (3/1/25-5/31/25). The Shopify United States Sales Tax Report here is filtered to only the nexus states we're filing in this month, which are the monthly filing states. The difference here is minimal and is due to a mixture of timely filing discounts and time zones; we share more details in this article . Overall, the Zamp tax-due estimate is lower than Shopify's reporting. In Washington, the difference ( $230.48 ) is due to the state's Business & Occupation Tax , which is a Gross Receipts tax imposed when filing Washington sales tax returns. Please let us know if you have any questions. Have an excellent rest of your week, and I hope that the weekend ahead is relaxing!"

No—Amelia and I were able to find a temporary solution for a tax code that will work for this scenario when utilizing the Zamp API. Amelia will be following up about that shortly! Regarding how to handle this in QuickBooks Online: To my understanding of QuickBooks Online's product and tax settings, it would be best to categorize the product or service item as a Nontaxable item for any of these 3% (or other percentage) fees associated with payment processing. As far as ""non-taxable income"" goes, I believe that would be a separate account (from sales tax) within QuickBooks Online after reading through this resource and this other resource. I'd still recommend that you confirm with QuickBooks Online support to be sure. Regarding using the ""gift card"" code: Yes—that code could be used here as well. Which would be: R_TPP_GIFT-CARD. The thought process on our end regarding the code Amelia will share is that it falls closer to a category that payment processing fees might be categorized under."

Amelia mentioned that it would likely be a case where it is a tpt item and we will have to calculate sales tax based on the full amount that the customer pays; sales price AND surcharge. Would that be the case, then? I'm still wondering how to best handle this for QuickBooks, as I originally thought it would be ""non-taxable income"" for the 3% fee. Sorry for the double message, our website programmer is trying to get the update rolled out asap and wasn't sure if someone else on the support email could jump in."

We're exploring options for this, as I don't believe we currently have a tax code specifically for credit processing fees.

The likely best path here would be to create a non-taxable item for credit card fees and then confirm via a test invoice that QuickBooks Online does not calculate tax for the item. If we make a non-taxable item for credit card fees, would it effect the total tax owed if other line items in the invoice are taxable? Or will it be avoided if Quickbooks isn't calculating sales tax on it? In this situation, the item's total amount won't be included in the taxable portion of the sales within Zamp, and it won't affect the tax owed, as Zamp files based on the tax collected. That said, the gross sales associated with the transaction would be slightly different in Zamp (grossed down), as we've discussed in the past. The upcoming and improved Zamp QuickBooks Online integration will help resolve scenarios like this, as we'll then receive taxability information from QuickBooks Online at the line item level (if the integration is used and configured). I hope this helps!"

I've connected with Taryn regarding the sales tax calculation situation for Michigan and confirmed that, while Zamp isn't planning to file sales tax returns in Michigan for Accelerated Tooling, the calculations can be handled separately. This would likely simplify the situation and increase accuracy. First, Zamp can provide the tax rates and calculate local sales taxes in Michigan for WooCommerce. Sales tax should also be collected in Minnesota and Texas within WooCommerce. 1) A quick question—would you like us to add MI for calculations within Zamp? The Accelerated Tooling Team will still be able to file MI sales tax returns, as this is a separate process from these calculations. 2) If they aren't enabled already, could you please also enable Minnesota and Texas for calculations within WooCommerce? We share how to enable calculations here , and each nexus state (MI, MN, and TX) would need to be added to the nexus states section: Please let me know if you have any questions, and I'm also happy to schedule a call if that would be helpful."

What tax configuration needs to be used to allow Zamp to calculate the local sales tax? I believe I may have misunderstood the situation here. I realized a bit ago that Accelerated Tooling does not have Michigan configured within their Zamp account and that a different approach may have been decided upon (for calculations and filing). I'm syncing with Taryn, Accelerated Tooling's Onboarding Manager, and will follow up once I've confirmed the proper configuration. We appreciate your willingness to work with us and your continued patience here!"

It's nice to e-meet you! I wanted to see if you could help us turn off the transaction sync to Zamp from the Accelerated Tooling LLC WooCommerce store. The reason for this is that Chris informed us that WooCommerce Transactions (orders and refunds) are entered into QuickBooks Desktop. Chris provides us with the QuickBooks Desktop data every month, and we aim to ensure that there are no duplicate transactions. We share how to turn off the transaction sync to Zamp in this article , and it involves unchecking this box: Navigate to WooCommerce —> Settings —> Zamp Tax —> Send Transactions . Questions: 1) Does the above make sense, and is there anything we can help you with here? 2) Are sales tax calculations enabled within WooCommerce? This should be the case as far as we know. We haven't seen any Texas or Minnesota transactions sync to Zamp, yet, so our visibility into this is limited. Please let us know if you have any questions! We're also happy to discuss this further during a call ."

Kyle: When you have a moment to review, I realized that at least part of the issue with the data importing was related to incorrect addresses, specifically those with the ' attn ' or someone's name in the shipToAddress1 column. I've attached the original file with the California-only data and the file that we imported into Zamp, as an example for comparison. The addresses with portions of the address removed and highlighted (in the 2nd file) are the transactions with suspected incorrectness.

A quick question: Anita, do we have your approval to include these missing transactions in the June 2025 filing period and return? Or do you have a different preference? I've attached the files that show the missing transactions. I will help ensure these are accounted for and provide extra review of the June 2025 data, once it's supplied and imported.

Explained the situation, and Kyle understood. Escalate to eng. Other notes and details: They've conducted extensive testing for July 1st with Zamp and are using Zamp for the filings. They might switch to Zamp calculations. Using the TaxJar API is inexpensive, and we want to avoid the technical work. They discovered that Alaska doesn't return the FreightTaxable flags in TaxJar. In Alaska, some municipalities calculate tax on shipping, while others do not, depending on the locality. Do you know if Zamp has already gotten this right? If so, they might move over. It's not a huge cost savings, but it would be good to have better accuracy. A feature request: Is there a way to look up a tax rate without a total? Just an address. If the address validation includes fields such as tax rate, freight taxable, etc., this could be useful. He's happy to hop on with product and engineering folks to hear their reasoning and why, etc. This is tied to how their ERP works; it stores a tax jurisdiction with a rate for the ship-to location, and they can't tie it to an order."

We've adjusted for the voided invoices by deleting them, as Zamp's Nexus Analysis does not include refunds in its analysis. This is based on our Tax Research Team's recent research, which confirmed transaction types considered in economic nexus thresholds. Zamp typically doesn't have a concept of voided invoices except to create a refund transaction. This way, those won't count towards economic nexus thresholds. We'll follow up with you in the July 2nd email thread to confirm the necessary adjustments have been made for the filings due this month and separately send a tax-due estimate. We appreciate your patience throughout this process!"

(sorry) I wasn't able to tackle the second part of your notes (the Metabase comparison), but I could compare transactions with the customer's file, and here are my findings: INV114 - April/2025:  Seems to be accurate, there is no tax collected, in both Zamp and the customer’s file, but the Sales Tax in Admin matches with the customer's expectation INV133 - May/2025: TransactionTotal and Subtotal = 8737; Tax = 0; LineAmount sum to -8737. Voided? INV141 - May/2025: TransactionTotal and Subtotal = 8925; Tax = 0; LineAmount sum to 8925. Voided? INV150 - May/2025: Flagged as RESALE, TransactionTotal and Subtotal = 18600; Tax = 0; LineAmount sum to 18600. Voided? Question: How can I check if we’re processing an order as voided in Admin?"

Also, in reference to your question about the voided transactions, these are preliminary invoices for bids and possible contract renewals. They may not actually be paid. That's why we void them. If we get the contract or renewal, then we will produce the final invoice which is submitted for payment. Does that make more sense? When I void it, the invoice reverts to $0 and should not be counted towards sales tax reporting. Best, Mary Beth"

I am working on Financials and am confused about the estimated tax payment made for April to California. The invoices you pulled from Quickbook were based on his invoices in April, not the payments received from customers for the sales tax collected. I show in April, over $9k in sales tax money was collected in payments. You paid significantly less. When I looked up the invoices numbers you referenced, these invoices were billed in April but not necessarily paid yet. Why weren't the taxes Chuck received in payments paid out for the estimated tax? I am attaching the report I have showing what taxes were collected by Forcible Entry in April. Please advise as they are a cash basis company and I think those tax amounts collected should have been remitted. Thank you, Renee"

I did not mention this permission to Taryn when we were discussing the situation; I'll be more careful in the future. Depending on how your BigCommerce store is configured (or the subscription, possibly), it appears that these should be the permissions we'll need based on what BigCommerce notes in this article : Export Orders Manage Export Templates There's a slight chance we'll need the ' Manage Orders ' permission, which we'd recommend removing after we gather the necessary order data.

ALSO they ended up returning 2 of the 3 Carlas, so part of this transaction is refunded also. 6/14/25 Cindy Olson 4701 Sunnyside Rd Minneapolis, MN 55424-1107 810 820 MN 55424 6/17/25 Bella Rubin 6 Holly Ln Lawrence, NY 11559-1317 United States 310 320 NY 11559 6/20/25 Siobhan Palermo 3016 Avenida Ciruela Carlsbad, CA 92009-2916 United States 320 354.22 CA 92009 6/20/25 Ali Goldberg 327 E 12th St, Apt 1 New York, NY 10003-7249 United States 580 590 NY 10003 6/20/25 Lola Rose 327 E 12th St, Apt 1 New York, NY 10003-7249 United States 270 280 NY 10003 6/20/25 Bella Rubin 6 Holly Ln Lawrence, NY 11559-1317 United States 310 320 NY 11559 6/20/25 Carla Hetland 9380 198th st, B langley, BC V1M3C8 Canada 1470 1512.05 Canada V1M3C8 This was a big order for a production company that was sent to canada. they paid for overnight shipping and were ok with the import costs too."

Regarding Order ID 229610: This makes sense! Yes, we're now seeing this transaction updated within Zamp: The updated tax-due estimate for Florida: The amount has been updated to $478.94 , which accounts for a Florida timely filing discount (also known as the Florida ' Collection Allowance ') of $12.28 . The total tax collected that we see is $491.22 , which aligns with the combined sum of the tax due, as noted in bold, and the timely filing discount. Here's an updated table with the FL amount updated: State code Period Estimated sales tax FL May 2025 $478.94 GA May 2025 $197.14 IL May 2025 $254.00 MI May 2025 $35.82 MN May 2025 $119.00 OH May 2025 $297.99 UT May 2025 $294.65 VA May 2025 $177.40 Estimated sales tax this month: May 2025 $1,854.94 Please let me know if we have your approval to proceed with the FL filing or if you have any questions."

I will have to figure that one out. I'm not worried about it since the taxes are paid and it's settled. The other one does have a tax free exemption because it's a church. I updated it with the API on our end. Please run the Florida report one more time and let me see if it coincides with what I have on my end.

2956910772,140400,9019680399,message,2025-06-09T18:50:46Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Ken, Thanks for the response; continued patience here! So, it should not be run in EST, it should be run in EDT should it not? Correct! In this situation, a time zone-related difference would be a bit different because of the following: Zamp's API receives date stamps (the transactionDate property) in UTC unless the time zone is specified in the request. I can confirm if this is the case if you or your team could share an example API request with me. Zamp then converts the UTC date/time stamp into EST for Florida. The above means that there can still be a slight variance depending on whether the date/time stamp sent to Zamp was in UTC or if it indicated the time zone was in EST. Here's how to indicate if a date/time stamp is in UTC or EST: For UTC, the date/time value would have a 'Z' at the end like this: 2025-06-09T18:40:00 Z For EST, the date/time value would have a time zone on the end of it, such as '-4:00' for EST (EDT, during Daylight Saving Time), such as: 2025-06-09T18:40:00 -04:00 That said, I don't believe time zones are the cause of the larger difference you've noted for Florida here, and I'll share more details below. The cause of the Florida discrepancy here: After digging into this further, I found that the cause of the difference was related to Order ID 229610 because this transaction was created within Zamp as if it should be fully taxable, and $0 tax was collected: For API integrations such as Wired Watts' integration with Zamp, our tax-due estimates are based on what should have been collected via the Zamp API (the taxDue amount). A few questions: 1) Should this transaction be treated as RESALE (wholesale) or something other than fully taxable? 2) If so, does Wired Watts have the ability to update the transaction via the API? We can sort out a path forward for adjusting to this situation once we have more details. I'm also happy to hop on a call with you if that would be helpful! Please let us know if you have any questions."
2956910772,140400,9019650433,note,2025-06-09T18:35:50Z,chris@zamp.com,"Research: I don't see any negative jurisdictions in FL , so that's not the cause. Time zones don't account for this either, because when adjusting for UTC, there is only one extra transaction worth a few dollars in sales tax. This issue appears to be related to Order ID 229610, as it has $0 tax collected but a taxDue, which is likely due to the API. https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/3319-variance-reviewing-by-transactiontax-table?companyId=cm3j4a2ee01c1jx82bksg33hq&stateCode=FL&startDate=2025-05-01&endDate=2025-05-31"
2956910772,140400,9002581032,customer,2025-06-03T20:47:39Z,ken@wiredwatts.com,"I understand the idea of the time zone thing if the state was in a separate time zone from us, however, that part of Florida is in the same time zone as us in GA. We are both in the Eastern time zone and practice daylight savings at the same time. We recorded the transaction to take place on 5/1/2024 at 12:40 am as did you. If the transaction came in at that time, it was May 1st when that person placed their order in that city in the United States. The only discrepancy would be daylight savings… which the United States takes part in. So, it should not be run in EST, it should be run in EDT should it not? Either way, it sounds like it was already paid for, and as you said, the ~$2 is not the issue here. However, I would like to hear your thoughts on this because this does not make our books align with whatever you are doing on your end. As for the major discrepancy, please let me know what you find. As stated earlier, you can take this email as a ""Go-Ahead"" on the rest of the filings, we don't need to delay that any further. Just hold off on Florida until we can get some clarity.

Regarding Transaction ID 841408 , Zamp is placing this transaction within the April 2025 filing period for Florida. This happens because Zamp files in each state based on the state capital's time zone . Because Florida is in the Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone and this transaction had a UTC timestamp of May 1, 2025, at 12:40 AM, it is included in the April 2025 filing. This transaction can be viewed on your Transactions page here . This transaction doesn't explain the full difference here, though. There are a few other items this could be related to, but we'll need to confirm. We'll investigate further and follow up as soon as we can."

We investigated this further and confirmed that the difference noted between 'Taxes Due' and 'Tax Collected' is related to the timely filing discounts and the Washington Business and Occupation (B&O) tax. There is some difference here due to sales tax rounding as well. The timely filing discounts can be reviewed on each state's sales tax filing (return) artifact available on your Zamp account's Filing Page here . The discounts vary in name but apply to each state with differences greater than approximately $1.00. In the future, we hope to display the timely filing discount in an easy-to-access way, and we've already started discussions with our engineering team about this. Have a great week!"

I'd also like to note that we need to hear back about this, have the situation sorted out, and receive approval to file your sales tax returns by the end of the day on Monday (6/16/25) to ensure the filings are processed on time for NY and CA."
2956898553,140303,9033866034,message,2025-06-13T14:12:03Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Richard, Thanks for your continued patience here! We've confirmed that the tax-due estimate Zamp shared is based on the tax collected from your Shopify store, which includes both in-person POS location sales and online sales. To our understanding, if a business has nexus in a state, sales tax is calculated and collected for in-person locations and online sales. Additionally, Zamp's tax-due estimate includes only the taxes we've seen collected within your Shopify store. I've attached an export of the transactions we've sold to or shipped to customers located in California and New York. It's important to note that the New York filing includes transactions from March 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025, because New York follows a fiscal quarter with a different date range than other states. A couple of quick questions: 1) To review this further and compare directly against Shopify's reporting, could you please share your Shopify store's Collaborator request code ? This code should be under Settings —> Users within your Shopify Admin. The collaborator access code is something separate from Zamp's automatic import of your Shopify transactions and allows us to review orders, sales tax reporting, and tax settings. 2) Also, could you let me know if we have your approval to proceed with After Market's filings this month? We've held the filings to allow time to investigate this and ensure we're all on the same page."

Yes—if this is completed over the weekend, that will give us enough time to get the data into Zamp, for Zamp's system to calculate the estimated tax due, and for us to get an estimate out to you. That said, we would need to have the filings approved and released by the end of the day on Monday. If that would be a stretch or tight turnaround on your end, we can push them into June 2025 to then proceed with $0 filings (with the goal being to file timely, avoid going to the overdue filings queue, and avoid penalties & interest from the state.) What would you say works best for you?"

Thanks for the update! No—the Sales tax ID field is optional, as Shopify notes in their article here (it's a good practice to add the tax ID when one is available). Just so you know, Shopify Tax is handling the sales tax calculations here, as Zamp is unable to calculate sales tax within Shopify. Zamp will, however, provide the economic nexus threshold monitoring, registration, filing, and compliance aspects of the puzzle."

I don't seem to be able to add members, please could you add Angus to the Zamp portal? Sure! I've added Angus as a user to the Ancient + Brave Zamp portal, and an invite was sent to angus@ancientandbrave.earth . If we should add Tom or others to the Ancient + Brave Zamp portal, please let us know either in this email thread or onboarding@zamp.com. Chris - should all wholesale transactions show as RESALE in Zamp, regardless of nexus/non-nexus/certificate exemption status? Yes—all wholesale transactions will show up as RESALE within Zamp, and we'd recommend implementing a process around this regardless of nexus/non-nexus considerations. The reason for the above is that some US states exclude Wholesale/Resale transactions from their economic nexus thresholds, and Zamp has logic in place to account for this, state by state. In terms of letting you know test orders to delete from Zamp, is there a deadline to communicate this to you before they get filed? Yes—we would need to know which transactions to delete (a date range or IDs/names) by the 5th of the month if Zamp is filing sales tax returns for Ancient + Brave, as that is typically the earliest date we would start filing. Can we also see US sales tax in the order in Shopify? Yes—once tax collection is enabled for a state within Shopify, the tax will show up as a line between Subtotal and Total on a Shopify order: Here's an example: I assume I can go ahead and set Ohio up as a state A+B collects tax in on Shopify safely before I go on holiday? Sure, if that works best for you! I'll need to do this before UAT starts, but it makes me nervous that we're using Zamp's live system to test on the test Shopify store - is there not a sandbox we can connect to? I understand, and we can certainly switch to using a Sandbox account here instead. I've created an account within Zamp titled ""Ancient + Brave Sandbox,"" and I've invited the following emails as users to this account. hello@emmaforward.co.uk angus@ancientandbrave.earth sophie@highcohesion.com A question here —since we're taking the sandbox approach with this, is it OK if we temporarily disconnect the Shopify store (ancientandbrave-us.myshopify.com) from the production account, named ""Ancient + Brave""? I could then also remove any test transactions that have synced so far."

Angus, is it helpful to add Tom too if he'll be supporting on UAT as well?

In terms of letting you know test orders to delete from Zamp, is there a deadline to communicate this to you before they get filed? Additionally, in the expected results on the UAT sheet, I've said to check Zamp for US sales tax calcs. Can we also see US sales tax in the order in Shopify? I don't see it as a line item in there currently when I look at a test order in Shopify, but we haven't set up Ohio as nexus yet.

Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team, and I'm jumping in to help after syncing with Caroline about your questions. Also, I'm in the process of writing the testing scripts for the Shopify integration. Are there any particular testing scenarios you think are worth including? We'd recommend testing some basic scenarios here, and other testing depends on the third-party Shopify apps that are planned for implementation: An order shipping to a nexus state (e.g., Ohio) has tax collected. An order to a non-nexus state (not set up to collect tax) does not have tax collected. Orders for wholesale customers do not have tax collected and show up within Zamp as RESALE on the transactions page. If any third-party apps, such as those listed below, are used, we recommend reviewing those orders to ensure the tax amounts match within Zamp and Shopify (we can help if this is not the case or if these apps are planned). Loop - returns & exchanges. ReturnGo AfterShip Outside of the above, everything should be smooth sailing. I reviewed the Ancient + Brave store and confirmed that products are categorized and Shopify Tax is enabled. Also, once you know that your testing is complete, please let us know, and we can remove the test orders from Zamp by either the Shopify Order ID, Order Name, or a date range.

2945627338,136371,9052349075,note,2025-06-19T18:23:39Z,chris@zamp.com,"@carie - I've been working through the output Kyle shared. A few things: I realized we needed data from 11/1/23 to 12/31/24; we didn't need the October 2023 data, as we didn't file (per Nicole's notes above). The SUM of tax still doesn't match the tax due in the liability report , but that may be fine. I realized that we don't have the source data they're comparing against, so it's challenging to determine how close we are or whether this is the right approach to take. There are some transactions (highlighted in green in the attached file) that were created or updated after we filed for the customer. Although the amount is small, it may make a difference. I didn't see many transactions that had a difference between the Zamp created date and the updated date, meaning it's unlikely there were many updates to the data after we filed. There was one transaction, but it was updated 1 minute after it was created, and that shouldn't matter. This won't account for edited orders or partial refunds in Shopify (as Kyle noted here .) Could the customer be granted an extension, or should we schedule a call to talk about this more? They keep asking for the BigCommerce transactions or source files, but those will not match; we might want to explain that. I'd need more time to review the numbers and the data they're comparing against (we don't have all Nov 2023-Dec 2024 filing amounts uploaded into Zamp, it appears ). cc: @nick @ashleyD - in case either of you has thoughts or ideas.

April 2025: Colorado Florida Indiana South Carolina (significant difference, urgent.) Pennsylvania Tennessee (considerable difference.) Each of these states had changes in the tax due after correcting the addresses associated with their transactions. The hope here is to avoid any penalties and interest. The state reports and associated filings have been updated. We will have amendments for the March 2025 period and follow up about that separately."

We understand that process changes take time, and we appreciate your patience as we work through these scenarios. Sometimes, (like this month or last month), we can accurately sort through it later in the month than we'd like. We still have some outstanding items surrounding wholesale transactions and order edit review in historical periods that we're working through (it's taken much longer than expected due to the volume of data and unexpected delays on our end). OK, understood regarding wholesale transactions. Please let us know if the scenarios arise where tax is refunded or if you have any questions. You're very welcome! We're all set now and we'll be sure to reach out if anything comes up! Have a great rest of your week!!"

I've shared this with our team. The tax per state looks good to me and I've already approved it for payments. I also really appreciate the effort you're putting in to make sure everything reconciles correctly - it's important we're only paying taxes we're actually responsible for. Regarding Wholesale transactions : What typically happens on our end is that the customer reaches out letting us know tax was incorrectly applied, and we either have to reimburse them or they short pay the invoice, which then requires us to manually correct the order. Going forward, we'll tighten this up to ensure anything tagged as WholesaleNoTax is properly exempted and doesn't have tax collected. Appreciate your help on all of this - let me know if anything else is needed from our side. Best, Andy"

I've confirmed that after running our temporary workaround method to force the reconciliation between Zamp's tax amounts and Shopify's tax amounts, the estimate sent just a bit ago aligns with the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report for April 2025 when filtering by Shopify Destination states we're filing in this month; I've attached a copy of that export from Shopify. Regarding Wholesale transactions: I've also attached a comparison of a Shopify export (looking for the 'Wholesale' or 'WholesaleNoTax' tags), which shows several transactions tagged with a wholesale tax, that have tax collected and paid without tax refunds. There are about 10 transactions with either of these tags that haven't been paid yet (it looks like they have various payment terms), and one example is #490783 . For the transactions noted above with payment pending and a wholesale tag, will the tax be removed from those Shopify orders, and should we offset this within Zamp? Please let me know if you'd like to hop on a quick call to discuss."

Some status updates regarding these items: Ashley is still investigating because the March return hasn't been processed (or updated) in the way that we understood it should have. This likely involves a call to the Texas Comptroller. We'll make sure to reach out to you once we have an update. Confirmed. Now that the Shopify product categories have been updated, Shopify is collecting tax, and we have recalculated the transactions with a $0 tax; the Total Texas Sales should be a closer match to Shopify.

The estimate was generated after I adjusted for order edits; the work file is attached. There is a difference here due to sales tax rounding in various states, and some due to refunds causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions. The difference/variance is small percentage-wise. Time zone differences are no longer a factor here as this export adjusts for that; this is also possible within the Zamp portal. I've also sent Bobbi an invite to the Zamp portal as our multi-user login feature was released and I missed doing this, previously. I've also attached an export of all transactions within Zamp."

Many of the clients we work with who are also using QuickBooks Online either enter the tax rates manually or use QuickBooks Online's automated sales tax feature here . The good news in this area is that Zamp's teams have been working on an improved QuickBooks Online integration, which will support sales tax calculations powered by Zamp. This could also be a solution here, once released in the future. 2) This is good to know, and we understand. Hopefully, the automated tax calculation feature linked above will help with this as it should remove the need to enter the sales tax rates manually.

2936629091,132982,8926187970,message,2025-05-13T23:05:25Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Matt, Thanks for sharing these details. This makes sense to me! To our understanding, Affordable Screen Company should charge an 8.25% rate in Texas because you have a location in Texas. Texas is an origin-based sales tax state , meaning the rate charged is based on your Lewisville, Texas, location. This can vary with other states, especially if you don't have a location in that state. How do other companies handle this? This depends on the accounting/ERP system being used. In the past, I've seen other companies handle this by: Using the built-in (native) automatic tax calculation functionality in systems such as QuickBooks Online, NetSuite, etc. Configure manual rates within the system by city, state, and jurisdiction. Configure an average sales tax rate for various states (this can lead to a mixture of under- and over-sales tax collection). Implement an integration with a sales tax API like Zamp's API for real-time sales tax calculations (if technical resources are available)? A few questions to help us research possibilities here: 1) Which accounting system are you using? 2) Have you ever needed to charge sales tax for customers outside of TX within this accounting system, and if so, how was that set up in the past? We could also hop on a quick call later this week or next."

To our understanding (and Stripe's), the products (subscription) would be fully taxable in Texas, and the 80% alternate rate wouldn't apply here. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed is up to you, but I wanted to ensure we're on the same page. This was noted on 5/12: On the surface, the Texas sales tax calculation piece is correct to our knowledge for Software as a Service (SaaS), and we'll confirm CT's tax rate for this product type. As soon as we've confirmed these details or have more information to share, we'll follow up immediately. If you wish to categorize your product as Software as a Service (SaaS) within Stripe, that would achieve the goal of charging 80% of the full rate in TX with these codes: txcd_10103000 - Software as a service (SaaS) - personal use txcd_10103001 - Software as a service (SaaS) - business use Zamp's filing service would support the 80% alternate rate if Stripe is categorized with one of the codes noted above.

I’m following up on the tax treatment of your Substack newsletter as a digital good in Texas and Connecticut, as our Tax Research Team shared some additional context and discovered an item specific to Connecticut. In Texas , a Substack newsletter is classified as a digital good, treated as tangible personal property under Texas Tax Code § 151.009 . This means it is subject to the full sales tax rate, similar to physical goods, and not at the reduced 80% taxable threshold that applies to certain services like information or data processing services ( Texas Tax Code § 151.351 ). Substack's digital newsletter is a product, not a service. Specifically, downloadable articles (txcd_10303000) and non-downloadable articles ( txcd_10304102 ) are taxable sales in Texas. In Connecticut , digital goods are also considered tangible personal property and are generally subject to the standard 6.35% sales tax rate, as outlined in Special Notice 2018(8) . However, after further review, Connecticut exempts sales of newspapers, whether in physical or electronic form, from sales tax under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-412(114) . As a result, both downloadable ( txcd_10303000 ) and non-downloadable ( txcd_10304102 ) newsletter articles are exempt from sales tax in Connecticut. It’s worth noting that some platforms, like Stripe, may not distinguish between electronically supplied goods or services in their general categories, such as the Stripe Tax code txcd_10000000 , which is currently configured. This means that if the path to not distinguish between downloadable and non-downloadable is taken, Stripe and Zamp would treat Citrinitas' newsletter product as taxable in both CT and TX. I hope this is helpful, and please let us know if you have any questions."

2936435078,132883,8955947371,note,2025-05-21T16:19:06Z,chris@zamp.com,"From Tax Research (Mira) here: https://linear.app/zamptax/issue/TBD-349/request-confirmation-on-ptc-taxability-for-substack-in-texas-and 1.  Should a Substack newsletter be considered a digital good within Texas and Connecticut's definitions? Yes, an online newsletter is a digital good within both states, but the taxation varies (see below). 2.  Are digital goods in Texas fully taxable or taxed at a reduced rate or threshold of 80%, like SaaS is? Digital goods in Texas are taxed like tangible personal property. TX Letter Ruling 20005359L indicates that digital products are tangible personal property as defined in TX Tax Code § 151.009 (""'Tangible personal property' means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched or that is perceptible to the senses in any other manner, and, for the purposes of this chapter, the term includes a computer program and a telephone prepaid calling card.""). The 80% tax situation applies only to information services and data processing services ( TX Tax Code § 151.351 ). ""Information service"" is defined as ""furnishing general or specialized news or other current information"" unless it is furnished to a physical, printed newspaper licensed by the Federal Communications Commission ( TX Tax Code § 151.0038(1) ). Substack's digital newsletter is a product, ​not a service​. The service of providing information to a newspaper is different from the digital newspaper/newsletter that is produced and distributed. As long as Substack categorizes its product as a digital newsletter (rather than some sort of service), it has to treat it as a digital good. Therefore, in Texas, R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS for downloadable articles and R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS_NEWSPAPER for non-downloaded articles are both taxable sales (which we have correct in our system). 3 - Would a digital good be considered fully taxable in CT or taxed at a 1% rate? Special Notice 2018(8) indicates that digital goods are included in the definition of tangible personal property and are taxed at the 6.35% rate effective Oct. 2019. However, sales of newspapers, whether sold as physical copies or electronically accessed or transferred are exempt from sales tax ( Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-412(114) ). Therefore, in Connecticut, R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS for downloadable articles and R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS_NEWSPAPER for non-downloaded articles are both exempt sales (which we have correct in our system). I also want to point out that Stripe does not distinguish between an electronically supplied good or service at the ""general"" category that appears on Substack's support article . But for tax purposes, it is a vital distinction. It's up to the customer to classify their product correctly. In my opinion, a newsletter is a digital good, not a service. Let me know if I can be of further help!"

If we keep the refund transaction in April and cannot claim the $42.60 now, does it roll forward until it can be applied? In this situation, the transaction doesn't automatically roll forward until it can be applied. Still, we can manually move it forward to see if it can be accounted for in a future filing period.

2936399742,132860,8929389043,message,2025-05-14T17:28:30Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Nicole, Thanks for confirming these details! I've imported the credit memo, and that change is now reflected in our tax-due estimate. Regarding #2 —yes, that's correct! These would be related to any credit memos not sourced from Shopify and are processed within QuickBooks Online. Below is the updated tax-due estimate, but first, I wanted to share some details about the difference for Colorado. Regarding Colorado: The $42.60 difference for Colorado is related to a refund transaction (#1899), causing the tax amount for the Denver, CO local jurisdictions within the CO filing to become negative. This applies to the City, County, and special tax (e.g., transportation or facilities-related districts). God's True Cashmere didn't have enough sales in these jurisdictions throughout April 2025 to cover the full refunded tax amount. A portion of the refunded tax is excluded from the filing because the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) doesn't allow negative amounts in local jurisdictions when filing Colorado returns; the majority of states don't allow this. In a situation like this, Zamp would need to file the sales tax return in CO as it is or after removing the refund transaction. As an exception, we can move this refund transaction into the May 2025 filing period to be processed in June 2025 if you'd like us to. Please note that we'll need to know how to proceed here by the end of the day (EST) tomorrow, May 15th, 2025 , to file for God's True Cashmere in a timely manner. If we cannot proceed or don't hear back, the filings will need to move into our overdue filings queue and could be subject to state-applied penalties & interest. Please let us know if you have any questions! Here's the updated tax-due estimate: 🗓️ Returns due in May In the table below, we have provided the estimated tax due for God's True Cashmere, LLC.

I'm part of the Technical Success Team here at Zamp, and we've been investigating the differences noted for the November 2025 filing period. After further review, it appears that Shopify Tax collected amounts for the October 2024 filing period (10/1/24-10/31/24) were used for the comparison on the 'Zamp-Filings' sheet of the file you shared. I've attached a modified version of your XLSX file with an extra sheet showing the November 2024 Shopify tax collected amounts on their own; this is on the 'Z Shopify Review - Nov 24' sheet. The 'Zamp-Filings' sheet has been updated with those amounts. That said, we're still seeing close to a 12% difference between Zamp and Shopify for Oklahoma and Rhode Island ; those are highlighted in blue. In both of these states, Zamp filed overdue returns in January 2025, while they were due in December 2024. The differences here are due to penalties & interest assessed by the state. The differences that are under or within ~2% are very likely due to timely filing discounts, rounding, or time zone differences; we share more info about that here . We also reviewed your account for known third-party apps (such as Loop, which Zamp accounts for and appears to be appropriately configured) or edge-case scenarios that might cause differences. A quick question: Which Shopify Report do you use to reconcile and compare? In our Comparison, we used the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report because Velvet Caviar uses Shopify Tax for the calculations. We've found this report to typically align closely with Zamp (with a few differences noted above). It also appears that you're likely using this report, but we wanted to confirm. If you'd like to discuss this on a call next week or sometime soon, please use this link to schedule a call . Have a wonderful weekend!"

When registering in California, the state flagged the original nexus start date as potentially being after the point of crossing the economic threshold and they wanted Velvet Caviar to reassess this information. After further conversation with Paul, the nexus start date was reassessed to March 1, 2023. This was resolved in February after the Q4 2024 deadline resulting in penalties and interest associated with the filing. This is the difference you are seeing for this period. We are reviewing these periods and will keep you updated. Thank you! In New York, you are on a quarterly prepayment filing frequency so the majority of the tax had already been submitted as ""Advance payments"".

I also took another pass at reconciling the Shopify sales report. I understand there may be some timing differences, but I wanted to flag a few discrepancies and get your input: California Q4 shows a large discrepancy 129K paid vs 115K on the report-do you have any insight into this? November filings across multiple states also seem off. Was there a specific issue that month that could be contributing to these variances? Could it also be tied to the California Q4 discrepancy? Just a heads up: the Shopify report I'm using includes returns in the tax totals. Lastly, regarding New York : it looks like we began filing monthly starting in December, but the Q4 NY filing totals only show about $11K-did we potentially miss a month?

We've started investigating this and haven't yet found the exact (or entire) root cause. We've discovered eighteen 2024 exchange transactions processed through Loop that could be a part of the difference you're seeing. We'll also dig deeper into Loop return transactions. In the past, these transactions have been processed correctly with Zamp because our Shopify integration has some Loop-specific logic in place for handling those. When you have a moment, could you please share a copy or export of whichever report you're using to determine this potential variance? This will help us remain on the same page and compare similar data sets. We'll find the pattern and root cause one way or another! We hope to have more details to share by early next week!"

So far, I see very few Loop transactions that overstate the tax due because we see Loop exchange transactions without tax listed (which would mean they probably have the Loop Discount disabled, which is what we want). https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2sou8001uto8m6dh2m8ykj/transactions?search=EXC&date=2025-01-01%7E2025-05-08&limit=100 That said, there are ~15-18 transactions since we started filing (8/1/23-5/8/25) where Loop transactions associated with exchanges have tax associated with them; these would typically cause duplicate tax. We'll need to dig into this further, but these can also be adjusted for within future periods. https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/5644-find-shopify-loop-exchange-transactions-with-tax-collected-v2?company=clv2sou8001uto8m6dh2m8ykj&start=2023-08-01&end=2025-05-08 We'll also need to manually review their Shopify transactions vs. Zamp transactions because they're using Avalara for tax calculations in Shopify , which is trickier to investigate. (We don't have the Shopify US Taxes report to work off of, just the 'taxes' report , which I'll need to review more.) That said, Zamp's estimate is under the total tax collected for April 2025 in the 'Taxes Report', but that's likely due to filing frequency differences and time zones."

Our engineering team recently completed the data removal request, and we've imported the QuickBooks Online data manually. I've attached an XLSX file showing the invoices and credit memos we exported from QuickBooks Online, with rows for invoices missing addresses highlighted. The rows highlighted in blue are invoices missing addresses within the March 2025 and April 2025 filing periods. Invoices before March 2025 are highlighted green if they're missing addresses. We'd love to have the addresses for these as soon as possible (ideally today) so that we can proceed with your filings. Alternatively, those invoices could be included in a future filing period. We should have an updated tax-due estimate heading your way within the next hour . For Zamp to file on time, we would ideally move forward with your approval to file by the end of the day today , which is a tight turnaround time. If you have questions or would like to, we can also hop on a quick call. I'm available from 2:30 to 4:00 PM EST today and can send out a calendar invite if that time works as well (it won't show on my calendar link). I'm happy to help with questions via email, too!"

We'd need to use: The United States sales tax report and the Transactions version of that report. I'd usually run the Shopify forced recon script here, and we still could, but I did that already for this customer before filing. We'd likely want to look at the results of Variance reviewing and j urisdiction-level queries to see if anything stands out. Suppose they have a bunch of refunds in various states, making the amount in the jurisdiction-level query negative. If the amount is negative and ends up being close to the difference here, that is likely the culprit. There's a good chance the differences are just time zones, rounding, etc, as the overall difference is only ~6.6%, but it's high in some states. Lucas or I are happy to help with this too, if there are questions."

For Invoice 5894, I believe what is happening here is related to some updates we made to our QuickBooks Online export processing script that are likely improperly processing the street address (the way QuickBooks Online formats/stores their addresses can make some of this tricky). We use the zip code to determine the state a transaction belongs in, but for some reason, it's using the full address. We'll revert our script updates or find a way around this situation. We'll sort this out today, review all other transactions, and likely re-import the data to ensure accuracy."

We have properly adjusted the amounts using the exchange rate provided in QuickBooks Online and dividing the 'Amount' and 'Tax Amount' values by that rate. For transactions where the invoice was in CAD but billed to a US address, we used an exchange rate of 1.34. I've attached a file showing the work (this Zamp Sales Tax QBO Report) around the exchange rate math and the file we imported into Zamp. I've also attached a file showing the current transactions in Zamp because we still see over $100k in sales to PA from 5/1/24 to 4/30/25, one of the periods used to evaluate PA economic nexus thresholds. This is using a mix of data from Stripe and QBO. A few questions: 1) Do you know if the files look right to you regarding the amounts? 2) Do you know if the PA Transactions still match your expectations?"

But I think I found the issue 😊 What I believe is happening is that things are importing with a translation issue. If we're using the foreign currency, then the integration is multiplying by the currency conversion rate instead of what we should be doing, which is dividing. As an example, Invoice 6448 should total $18,000 USD but is showing up as ~$36,800 USD in Zamp (see attached screenshots). If I take the QBO canadian amount of $25,734.33 CAD, and divide it by $18,000 USD, that implies a 1.429685 exchange rate. But $25,734.33 * 1.429685 = $36,791.99 which is what is showing up in Zamp.

We're still evaluating the situation and data from multiple angles. We've had a few unexpected delays. So far, we haven't found evidence of transactions sold through Marketplace Platforms having tax attributed to them within Zamp because Zamp will attribute a $0 transaction tax value for Meta, Shop, and TikTok if our integration ""knows"" that the transaction is from one of those channels. By extension, this should mean that the Taxes Collected Report shouldn't include Marketplace Facilitator tax collection. This situation is tricky because, to my understanding, not all SHOP transactions will be associated with Marketplace Facilitator tax collection. That said, I'd like to be sure we're on the same page and have a couple of quick questions: Note—I will also sync with Ashley about this when we're all back from the US holiday this weekend. 1) Which Marketplace or Shop Channel transactions do you see tax collection for, within Zamp? 2) If a specific transaction wasn't the cause of the concern, was this related to differing amounts in the liability review process? 3) To ensure we're comparing and reviewing the same data sources, could you please let us know which Shopify Reports were used in this liability review and reconciliation process? Was it the United States Sales Tax Report , the Taxes Report , or something else? Have a wonderful weekend!"

As I mentioned, the main goal is to be able to support the liability on our B/S. Currently the only two reports available are the 1) Taxes Collected report and the 2) Tax Liability report. The tax collected report includes taxes collected on marketplace platforms so this report overstates our liability. While the tax liability provides a fairly accurate tax liability for states that are reported monthly, however the tax liability report does not provide the tax liability for states with a quarterly, semi-annual or annual reporting requirement like Illinois which has an annual reporting. Any help on providing a report that would support our tax liability would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Sandy Jones Iron Clad Consulting Controller"

In our analysis, we have found transactions that are not being remitted as they should.  I'd like to set up some time to understand why Zamp is not reporting and sending sales tax on the following Shop Channel Transactions and what needs to be done to correct this.  I could not find a way within Zamp to set up a time to discuss these issues so I am reaching out via email. Following are the general areas that I would like to discuss with you: Shopify Payments - the majority of the transactions are flowing through to Zamp with a few exceptions.  For example, transaction ID 6005407449255 - Shopify shows $2.56 in sales tax collected but Zamp did not report these taxes. TikTok - This looks like an integration we may need to add as no TikTok transactions are being reported.  How do we go about getting this Channel added in Zamp? Shop Cash / Shopify Payments - when a customer uses Shop Cash, Zamp is not remitting the sales tax - Is this a separate integration?  Why would this be?  For example, transaction ID 6005255405735 - Shopify shows $6.24 in sales tax collected but Zamp did not report these taxes. How are returns handled?  Do they just flow into the next month's reporting? How do we go about getting the previous month's sales tax reported/sent to the proper governmental authorities? I have copied Sam Bauman, David Protein's Director of Finance, if you need any authorization to speak to me on his account.  Please suggest a few times when we could discuss the above or send me a link to select a time to meet. Thanks, Sandy Jones Iron Clad Consulting Controller (928) 261-0357"

I reviewed all of the Batch Services tax-due estimates before sending them out, and it appears we have some adjustments to make for refunds, causing negative balances in local jurisdictions. I'm triple-checking some items with this and hope to have more details to share by tomorrow, 5/7/25."

We're working through some data items for the month, including Barton's eBay transaction import. Once we've imported the eBay data, we'll send out the monthly filing email to ensure marketplace (or any) transactions are included in the filing. For April 2025, Barton shouldn't have any filings due as their filing frequencies are all quarterly, annual, or semi-annual. This means we'll send a ""no filings due"" email within the next few days."

I went through all transactions with a note attached and was actually surprised at how many were accurate . For example, 74075 shows all the correct logic, following best accounting principles: - Taxable transaction - Refunded transaction - Recreated transaction as exempt On the other hand, the exact same scenario is a bust for some reason (74018): - Taxable transaction - Refunded transaction - Recreated transaction as exempt - Refunded the recreated transaction as exempt. For some of the other orders where there was an adjustment/change, I noticed we didn't create the transaction with the appropriate change, or it was just left as refunded. This was the case for 140162 and 140425. I had corrected these. In either case, the guys are going to kick a new notice your way that is mathematically sound to the transaction exports I did from BigCommerce. I'm going to take these issues to my write-up for the integration developers. Thanks! Ryan"

I wrote something to handle a comparison where the order notes field was used to look at the records in Zamp. It produces a trail to show all coinciding transactions produced on our end. This also works as a precursor to looking back at old records from before we talked about using the order notes field. The ""Difference"" log line is a comparison of the ""Order Total (Inc Tax)"" from a BigCommerce orders export to the Zamp net total after all the records. There are some examples further down the trail where the difference is more apparent. I think there were a total of 14 orders across SSM and PSP that have order notes from April. This work will continue into the end of the week, when I hope to clear getting a new notice your way from our team. As for the actual app and corrections to the integration itself, still getting the details together for the team that manage the integration. We're still closing out some prior work.

Any technicalities or specific configurations that caused it doesn't invalidate the fact that the API got it wrong and caused the customer justifiable frustration. Regardless, we have already implemented such functionality in our checkout process. It displays a simple warning when the address entered is marked as invalid by the inconsistent /addresses validator, and it allows the checkout to continue without sales tax calculation in such cases. Thanks, Ethan B"
2929702398,129963,8921443114,message,2025-05-12T20:35:08Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Ethan, Thanks for the response! No—I was referring to a slightly different configuration (and likely UI updates) or checkout flow to ensure address validation doesn't prevent the customer from continuing through checkout. I've seen Magento or WooCommerce implement address validation in this way and have heard from clients I worked with in roles elsewhere of similar changes (this might be a big lift, and is not necessarily required.) From our standpoint, the /addresses validation is correct as it was initially built and needs a configuration tweak. Zamp uses more data sources with higher accuracy overall, or at least simply a different way of processing the data (From the Google Maps API), which can result in variance with other address validation services. I hope this helps!"

In a situation like this and in general, it might be worth implementing some 'select an address' functionality to display the original address and the updated address, if any; if there isn't another address, allow the checkout process to proceed. In general, address validation shouldn't prevent the checkout process from completing. We also understand if this isn't an option here."

Our Engineering Team told me that Zamp viewed the address as invalid because of a data and geolocation quality indicator we have in place for address validation. Here's a bit of detail: Zamp's /addresses API endpoint is currently configured to allow only rooftop or parcel address precision confidence levels, and we receive a zip9 response for this address, but we also received an indicator that DPV = 'Y' This happens because Zamp utilizes a different address validation solution than Google, with a broader mix of data. We found a strategy here that would allow addresses with a DPV value of Y for this scenario and cast a wider net for valid addresses, an indicator tied to the data existing within a USPS dataset. We've passed along a feature request that would add the DPV item noted above to the validation ruleset, and we hope to have it released in the future. Once this is released, we'll be sure to follow up!"

We've resolved the differences, and an updated tax-due estimate will be sent out within the next few minutes. The good news is that our filing team will be able to file these returns on time, and there will be no late charges from the states. We keep these dates in mind as we work through various situations, and we'll communicate this more clearly going forward. For Illinois and Iowa filings, we have until 5/15/2025 to file on time, ideally we would file before that date. We looked into this further and found the following items contributed to the differences here: For Iowa , we found that Transaction ID 144 had a date of 4/29/ 26 instead of 4/29/ 25 , causing the transaction to be placed in a future filing period. We have updated this, and we've made improvements to prevent situations like this from occurring in the future. For Illinois , we found that the difference you noted was due to our tax-due estimate automatically accounting for the Illinois timely filing discount (also known as the 'Retailer's discount'), and that estimated amount is $398.00 . The IL Retailer's discount is applied when filing on time and is 1.75% of the sales tax collected. Please let us know if you have any questions. I hope that you have a wonderful weekend!"

Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team following up about the differences Tammy noted in another email thread with Caroline. We appreciate your patience with this. After further investigation, we found that Zamp had $0 listed as the estimated tax-due amount for Virginia and Illinois because Zamp views your product as tax-exempt in those states. In these situations, we can ask our filing team to file the tax collected amount instead of the tax-due amount. I understand that the Bondaware team has filed the April 2025 returns; we'll note this on the Zamp side. I'll sync with Caroline tomorrow about how or if those amounts must be recorded within Zamp."

TL;DR - I realized this is happening because Zamp views this customer's product (with the R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS tax code) as tax-exempt . So, the IL and VA notices are generating with $0 tax due. I can share a more detailed breakdown and how to spot this in ~1 hour. I'll follow up with the customer too, if that would help, but wanted to tirple-check with you first: Were they expecting us to pay the tax they collected, or were they going to refund the tax collected (Technically, over-collected) to their customers?"

We don't yet support noting timely filing discounts or the Washington B&O tax within our tax-due estimates, but our engineering team has active feature (or improvement) requests open to potentially add this functionality in the future. In the meantime, we're happy to confirm these details before filing in the future (as we've done here). Also, I do not see where we can approve the April returns to file. Yes, I will send the tax-due estimate out shortly, as this is separate from the usual Zamp app/portal. In the future, this filing approval functionality will live within a new section of the Zamp app."

To ensure we're on the same page, are we wondering why the 'Tax Collected' and 'Tax Due' values differ? If the above is the case, I've outlined our findings for the states noted below. Colorado - This difference is due to the CO's timely filing discount. Florida - this difference is also due to a timely filing discount for FL. Illinois - This is another difference due to the timely filing discount for IL. Washington—This difference is caused by the Business & Occupation gross receipts tax (0.471% of all transactions) due when filing sales tax returns in CO, which is 34.97. If the above helps and makes sense here, it appears that adjustments won't be needed for the April 2025 filing period, we can skip the adjustment imports this month, and send the tax-due estimate out, today. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I checked in with our Head of Filing, who noted that if we cannot access the Shipping address details in Target's order exports and sales tax report exports, we can place the Target Plus transactions into a zip code within that state. Ultimately, our primary recommendation is to either implement a third-party tool like Acenda (or something similar, but this isn't an endorsement) or contact Target Plus Seller Support via the Target Plus portal to find a way to obtain an export from Target Plus with the shipping address data. Working with Target Plus Seller Support is likely the best path forward here. It may involve submitting a ticket to them (or emailing them) via the 'Support' section on the left-hand side of the portal, as during our call, we saw that the 'support' option was some chatbot. When you have a moment, could you please share a CSV file with the Target Plus transaction data listed by state? I'm also happy to hop on another quick call if you'd like to discuss any of this or have any questions."

For the Target data: Possibility: Can we pick a random city, state, or zip code to associate the transactions? They can get totals per state from a sales tax export from Target. The orders exported don't contain addresses, but they contain amounts. The returns export doesn't contain amounts, but it includes a return location, sometimes."
2926052609,128982,8902147962,message,2025-05-06T14:04:43Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Sarita, Thanks again for your patience! We reviewed the Target Plus file and found that while it does contain some of the information we need, it's missing the Ship To Address details. To import and use the data in sales tax filings, Zamp would need at least the Ship To Zip code , or the Ship To City and Ship To State . Also, Zamp would need every row in the CSV file to contain amounts (discounts, subtotal, etc.) and a transaction date. Unfortunately, we haven't had to export data from Target Plus yet, as we haven't received this kind of request in the past. If we find or think of any customers also selling through Target Plus, we'll ask them how they approach it. That said, we did some research here and this is what we've found: The Target Plus Reports do not contain the shipping addresses. A third-party tool like Acenda could obtain an export that includes the Shipping address ( ChannelEngine and other tools don't appear to have this ability, but there may be others). We don't specifically endorse any tool here, as this is new to us. It might be best to contact Target Plus Seller Support via their portal using the help/support features. Target Guest Relations may also be able to direct you to the correct department by calling 1-800-440-0680. Based on our research (what we can find online), it is not easy to get the data Zamp would need for Target Seller Plus sales. If you can see a way to obtain the city and state for the orders within Target Plus, we could use that data, but otherwise, it appears to be tricky to accomplish this. If you'd like, we're also happy to schedule a call with this link to share your screen and see if we can find any way around Target Plus' limitations here. If a time on my calendar won't work for you, please let me know what days and times work for you, and I'll check with other folks at Zamp to see who might be available. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

We were able to import most of the data you sent over. However, we could not import 55 transactions with a total of $756.23 in sales tax due to underlying issues with the source system (an ERP, I believe). I've included these transactions and the errors involved as an attachment here. Questions: 1) Have conversations with the ERP support team continued, or are any solutions in the works? 2) Could we also hop on a quick call sometime in the next few weeks to discuss this and see how we (Zamp) can help? I'm asking this because I understand that these scenarios occur nearly every month, and I'd like to help ensure the transactions related to this (and past months) are accounted for.

Yes—we can make an exception here, considering the situation with the missing data. We'll be able to hold the filings until the end of the day Friday, May 9th, 2025. We set this date to ensure the sales tax filings are processed before the state's due date and to keep our internal filing processes focused on efficiency.

We found a few root causes related to the difference here, and I've outlined those below. Refund Transactions with discounts where the tax refunded was lower in Zamp than Shopify—our engineering team is monitoring this, and an improvement is in progress. Order Edits to Shopify orders via Shopify's built-in return/exchange functionality. Shopify's APIs don't expose much of this to Zamp, and what we've seen in the past has been inconsistent and inaccurate. Our engineering team has this on their list to explore solutions for the future. A couple of edge case-related Shopify voided/canceled orders. This is also on our engineering team's radar. Please note that Shopify's tax amounts (within the US Sales Tax Report ) have changed a bit since the initial email: We've adjusted for the differences here and will send you an updated tax-due estimate. For now and until the features/improvements noted above are released, we'll account for these scenarios before sending the tax-due estimate in the future. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

After looking into the order examples you shared, the differences with these orders occur due to a form of order editing that uses Shopify's native (but newer) return/exchange functionality. We can tell this is the case when orders show removed/added items or note 'partially refunded' OB47903 From looking at the transactions page below, we show a remaining $9 for sales tax, but Shopify shows $7.92, so we're off a bit here; that's likely part of the cause (or all.) https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB47903&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 This is likely related to this in-progress feature request (issue..): https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/40979248/card_tables/cards/8390180624 ———————————- OB50115 This one looks like an order edit, but it also uses Shopify's return functionality. We don't even have the correct tax amount because of the order edit (removing an item directly in Shopify's UI): The Zamp transactions: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB50115&timezone=US/Local&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 $0 for a return/refund and $26.56 for tax. ———————————————————————— OB49868 This one is a voided/canceled order that is related to a different, known, issue. The order was never fulfilled and was voided, which Zamp doesn't currently capture. Zamp transactions: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB49868&timezone=US/Local&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 Related issue: https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/40979248/card_tables/cards/8390148844 —————————————- The solution for these: We can take the path outlined below because we don't see negative balances in local jurisdictions using this query (for Georgia at least). We should run the Shopify forced reconciliation script here: https://github.com/zamptax/zamp-technical-success/tree/main/utility/scripts/shopify_forced_recon_offset Then, after we allow an hour for the forced reconciliation adjustment transactions to be factored in, compare the Zamp notice amounts (the MB query here ) against the US taxes report to see if they're closer. I can do that today or tomorrow if that's better, or we can run through it together!"

2921967851,127211,8893471027,message,2025-05-03T00:53:35Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Catherine, Thanks so much for your patience here! I investigated this and found that Shopify support is correct here as far as I can tell, unless tax collection was never enabled for California. It seems that Shopify either defaulted to collecting taxes when an in-person CA location was added, or it was turned on at some point. Currently, the CA tax collection appears to be disabled per this Shopify taxes report. This appears to be related to the NC Crane AG location's address in San Luis Obispo County, which can be found in Shopify here . Shopify also shares a bit of detail about this here ,  when viewing this location in Shopify and on the ' Manage tax liability ' page here (also shown below): The tax collection for San Luis Obispo County and the city of CA could be correct based on the various tax rules within CA, as that is where this POS location is currently listed. We share more details about this in our California Sales Tax Guide here . We would call this intrastate sales tax sourcing, but as Shopify notes , it's sometimes called 'hybrid origin' sourcing. This type of tax collection involves collecting the California state tax, the county and local taxes of the in-person location, and the city and district taxes associated with the shipping address. The above would be correct if Semaine Health does have a physical location within San Luis Obispo County, is registered to collect and file taxes in CA, and the ' Hybrid-Origin ' tax setting was selected for CA: Zamp's sales tax API would calculate similarly if we knew that Semaine Health had this exact location. If you're not registered to collect in CA (we don't see that listed as such in Zamp) and aren't filing CA returns outside of Zamp, we recommend refunding the taxes collected to your customers if you haven't done so already. Suppose the CA tax wasn't enabled and the 'Hybrid-Origin' option wasn't selected. In that case, we'd recommend you continue to escalate this with Shopify for further investigation (based on our understanding of Shopify's settings and documentation). I understand that the above is a lot of information, which can be tricky (especially when explaining it to a customer). We're happy to hop on a call to discuss this sometime if you'd like! Do you think the above helps answer the situation here? If not, please let us know; we'll clarify! Please let us know if you have any questions, and have a great weekend!"

Unfortunately, the 'Criquet Shirts' Shopify Store access still appears pending. This is very strange, and as far as I can tell, you're doing everything correctly. Here's what we see: Is this effecting our filing process? Yes—we're currently holding Criquet Apparel's filings until we can run a bulk sync to update some items associated with Criquet's Shopify transactions. This is due to some changes made on Shopify's end, which required updating our integration. The good news is that we're on top of this and will be able to file on time for you. To file timely, we need to ensure your sales tax filings are moving into our process by Monday, 5/12/25. If needed, we have some additional time past that date, but we're hoping to keep things as efficient as possible. ——————————————————————————- Next steps: 1) Can you hop on a quick call about this so that we can screenshare? Or could you reach out to Shopify Support? I'd love to and am happy to help figure this out. Sometimes, we see delays in Shopify access making its way over to Zamp's partner account, but that's usually no more than a few hours. 2) Alternatively, could you follow the steps below to add the read_locations permission that the Zamp app now needs? I'm also happy to hop on a call to walk through this. Log in to your Shopify admin and select settings ⚙️ at the bottom left of your screen. Select ""Apps and sales channels."" Select the ""Develop apps"" button at the top right section next to the ""Shopify App Store"" button. Click on the ""Zamp"" custom app In the header section, click on ""Configuration.""

My name is Chris, I'm a part of the Zamp Technical Success Team, and I'm jumping in here to help sort this out as we were receiving some strange errors from Shopify when attempting to configure the Zamp app. Previously, Zamp's collaborator account was missing the 'read customers' permission (somehow), and this was likely the root cause. I uninstalled the Zamp app and will re-create it, but first, I needed to remove Zamp's collaborator access and re-send the collaborator access request.

Based on this article , Shopify Tax won't calculate taxes for an order if it contains one or more products with a tax rate override. However , it may work if the 'charge tax on this product' box is checked or unchecked. It might be a good idea to try setting these up as a shipping profile or a custom flat-rate option instead. That said, Zamp won't know how to treat these products (line items within an order) as shipping because our Shopify integration uses the order-level 'shipping' amount details to automatically handle shipping taxability; we don't currently have a shipping tax code due to this. If no tax is collected, Zamp will not remit tax to the state DOR, and that portion of the transaction(s) would be excluded from the filing. If tax is collected, we'll categorize it in our filings according to the proper jurisdictions, as most states only require shipping to be grouped with Gross Sales. Setting the taxability of these shipping products manually could work if they are marked as tax-exempt. However, we wouldn't want to apply a tax override (rate) here, because Shopify likely won't collect tax on the order. This should work with Zamp. Ultimately, I recommend checking in with Shopify Plus Support to confirm the best path and behavior when using Shopify Tax. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Most of my availability is in the afternoon (EST), but I can adjust my schedule if a morning time slot is better. Is there an API limit that is silently enforced? If so what is that limit? There is an API rate limit, but it shouldn't be silently enforced. Our API rate limit was recently increased by our engineering team last week and should now be 500 requests per minute. Also could you explain why it's returning so many taxes records for a single line item? Sure! This happens because a taxes object is returned for each tax jurisdiction (state, county, district, etc.), and this occurs for each line item within a transaction. The jurisdiction ""type"" (which can vary from one state to the next) is indicated by the jurisdictionDivision property's value within the object. How do I correlate these back together? Do I sum up for a given line item? This is a good question! In a situation like this, it would likely be best to sum the taxDue amount for each lineItemId if there are multiple line items; otherwise, the taxDue value above the taxes array could be used if there's only a single line item. Regarding the $0 tax due returned for this calculation: This happened in this request's instance because Zamp currently treats line items with the general digital products tax code (R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS) as tax-exempt in Virginia. A way to determine if this is the case is if the taxDue amount in the Zamp calculation response is 0 and the taxableAmount is also 0. I'm also happy to take a look at additional examples. As I can in the morning, I'll review some API calls sent to Zamp for the test account."

I've attached a few files for your review, along with the tax-due estimate: Per our usual process, the 'shopify_orders_export_1-edited' file is the source file for accounting for the edited and voided orders. The ' Ravella - Shopify Edit and Void Adjustments ' file is the adjustments file imported into Zamp to account for this. The 'RAVELLA Zamp Export' file contains all the transactions used for the underlying estimates and filings within Zamp. A quick note about the differences you'll see in the last file vs. the tax-due estimate: The tax-due estimate has an amount that is very much an estimate, which does not fully account for all of the CA prepayments already made (our engineering team has in-progress improvements to better account for this), and here's the breakdown of those payments: The total tax collected was $18,116.00 . The January 2025 prepayment was $6,552.00 . The February 2025 prepayment was $7,709.00 . The remaining should be closer to $3,855 . For Washington, $183.94 is attributed to WA's B&O (gross receipts) tax, due when filing returns but not collected from customers. The other states' differences are minor and within the % margin for rounding, timely filing discounts, and other state-specific tax logic. We weren't able to account for refunds that caused negative amounts in local jurisdictions in the past, but we are still tracking this and plan to work that into the May 2025 filing for April 2025. Please let me know if you have any questions. We're still working towards getting this data to you earlier in the month, but we have had some unexpected delays in the last few weeks. I'm also happy to hop on a call if you have any questions."

I've confirmed with Becky that we will start filing for The Raw Office in May 2025 for the April 2025 filing period. Our team also recently imported the historical data for the Raw Office and escalated a priority request to our filing team to submit the CA Q4 2024 return. We're hoping to be able to file this return this month, as you're receiving state notices. Once the CA Q4 2024 return has been filed for TRO, we'll follow up!"

Sure! Our Engineering Team has implemented measures to account for Marketplace sales through Shopify's Shop app. These measures detect these transactions using Shopify App ID values provided in Shopify's Admin API Orders endpoint data. Our Shopify integration can detect this when your store's transactions sync with Zamp. Zamp will then file the sales tax returns associated with the Shopify transactions where Shopify does not collect sales tax as a marketplace. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any additional questions."

Becky and I synced about this and confirmed that we see monthly sales tax return filing options for Eastside Golf in Florida when we review the available filing period dates (called ' Collection Period ' on the FL e-file DR-15 filing): This is why FL is set up as a monthly filing state.

The difference here is likely related to God's True Cashmere's quarterly prepay filing frequency with CA, which means that Zamp makes monthly prepayments to CA before filing the actual quarterly filing. Overall, in QuickBooks Online and Zamp, I see that the total tax collected in CA was close to 12,852.00 when adjusting for time zones. The previous prepayments were: The January 2025 prepayment made in February 2025 - $2,910.5. The February 2025 prepayment made in March 2025 - $4,417.74 Total combined: $7,328.24 Remaining tax-due estimate: $5,523.76 Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I'll answer your questions below, and I'm happy to hop on a call sometime if that would be helpful. What I thought was happening is that we overpaid sales tax at the beginning so this was the credits being applied. Is this correct? Yes—this is correct! There were duplicate transactions between a manual CSV import and a QuickBooks Online integration. If so, why are we not taking the full credit for the amount owed each period? Or is it something different? The plan we discussed previously (correct me if I'm wrong, Sadh) is that we would adjust for 10% of the overpaid sales tax each month to prevent sudden changes in Gross Sales and Tax Due amounts from month to month. Another reason here is that some states don't have a tax due amount when we're filing or a filing is not due. I hope this helps!"

We'll need to investigate further, but we'll likely want to disconnect the current Amazon integration with Zamp because we have that sales data syncing separately. If the Amazon data flows into Shopify, we won't need the Amazon connection, as Zamp will handle the transactions from either source. Within Zamp, we'll always view transactions from Amazon (either the direct integration or Shopify) as $0 tax to ensure that tax is not remitted twice because Amazon collects and remits as a marketplace facilitator. The good news is that this won't cause any tax duplication but may cause duplicate amounts within Pacagen's Gross Sales amounts. However, we can quickly help sort that out. A few questions: 1) Do we know when this change was made to bring Amazon transactions into Shopify? Was it effective on 4/8/2025? 2) Was this change applied to historical (before X date) data in any way? 3) Could you or the team share examples of Shopify Order IDs synced to Shopify from Amazon? I've found a few, but I'd like to be sure. The examples I found are: #37965 #37961 #37911"

The fastest route to resolve this could be to remove the Odoo CSV file we imported and use the Shopify data to file the returns this month. That's also an option, and I wanted to confirm with you what path you'd like to take considering that information. The Shopify synced transactions' combined total tax amount for March 2025 is $29,580.29, while the Odoo file's is $29,364.86. This difference could be related to time zones. Additionally, while reviewing Joolca's Zamp account, I found that Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, and Utah all have quarterly filing frequencies, but Zamp doesn't have the January 2025 data. If we stick with the Odoo CSV import path, could you please also provide the January 2025 data in the same format as the March and February data?"

After that, we can generate a tax-due estimate and get the filings moving. Just so that you know, the Shopify integration allows the process to be automated. Still, we're also happy to handle it this way if Odoo is the source of truth—this is the preference here—or if importing the data from Odoo instead simplifies reconciliation processes for you all."

I've reattached the sales figures for Joolca Inc. for March 2025 (this includes both B2B and B2C customers). Just a quick clarification on the data: all our transaction IDs start with INV , and credit notes begin with RINV . Looking at the file you have on hand, I noticed that by row 1163, the transaction IDs appear to have changed to numerical values only. I suspect these might be transactions pulled directly from Shopify? To confirm from our end, we use Odoo as our source of truth. The Excel spreadsheet I've provided is extracted directly from Odoo, so there's no need to pull data from Shopify. Does the above make sense, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

As requested, we've held Joolca's filings until we have your approval to proceed. Just so you know, we will need to hear back with approval to file by the end of the day (EST) on Friday, April 11th, 2025 , for Zamp to be able to process your filings timely this month. A few states, such as Maine (with a 4/15 due date) and Michigan (for the timely filing discount), have earlier due dates or timelines. I've attached two XLSX files containing the transaction data Zamp used to build these tax-due estimates. Each file includes a sheet showing the tax total per state and overall. The combined tax total across all monthly and quarterly states with due dates this month is $62,015.96 . It's important to note that the Washington March 2025 filing and estimate also include a WA B&O tax (gross receipts tax) filed with the sales tax return; this amount is $342.40 . In addition to the above, Zamp's tax-due estimates have various state-specific logic in place for handling time zones, rounding, and timely filing discounts; we share some details about this here (also here ). I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions."

We determined the cause of the differences in the QBO numbers and Zamp's notice. For Oklahoma and Texas, there was 1 transaction for each state that did not import with the automation. I have added those transactions and that will be reflected in the new notice. The transaction ID's were 25233 and 25146. The difference with Washington is due to the Business and Occupancy tax that WA requires, which was $17.97. We will get a notice over to you shortly, please let me know if you have any further questions."

I believe the difference here is that API calls are considered 1/10th of an order because a single order (transaction) typically involves multiple sales tax calculations due to item changes, address changes, etc., before checkout.

What report am I supposed to be looking at? and what report do you use? This is a tricky question to answer, but generally, the Shopify US Taxes report you shared is the better report to start with. That being said, there will almost always be some differences (usually 1-2% but under 5%) between Shopify and Zamp; we share more information about that in this article . The differences are usually caused by rounding, timely filing discounts, or differences in time zone handling (Zamp adjusts for each state's specific time zone). Zamp doesn't use a Shopify Report to build our filings and ingest sales data because we use the data provided by Shopify's API. If we need to reference something in Shopify for a tax-related report, we will generally look at the US Taxes Report. When did you loose access to the Shopify store? Thanks for the access code! I just sent a request over. Unfortunately, we're unsure when the access was lost because Shopify hasn't shown us the date. This is an access that can auto-expire after 90-days. We've started some conversations with our engineering team to find ways to prevent this from happening. The good news is that this only affects our ability to view your Shopify store and doesn't affect Zamp syncing your sales data for filing purposes. I'm still reviewing the situation here but should have more detail before our call tomorrow."

Ashley and I would be happy to review this on a video call with you. Please use our scheduling link here to set up a call next week. Please note that Zamp automatically released Kings Loot's filings earlier, and the below state filings have already been processed, but we have paused the filing for any remaining states. Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Washington D.C., and Virginia. Once we understand what is happening here and determine the best path forward, we'll help determine what can be done regarding any already filed states. We will have some flexibility while working through the differences you've found and will target getting the filings for Kings Loot moving back into the process by next Friday (4/11/25). This will allow us to ensure the filings are still filed on time. A few quick questions ahead of our call: 1) Which report in Shopify are you using to work through the comparison here? Could you please share an export or screenshot of this report? 2) Could you also please share a couple of amounts associated with the states with the highest differences? 3) When you have a moment, could you please share Kings Loot's Collaborator request codes with us for the for-a-kings-loot and kingslootwholesale Shopify stores? This will allow us to request access to your Shopify store again because that access expired automatically according to Shopify's policy. This access will speed up our investigation and is separate from Zamp's ability to sync Shopify sales data. This code should be found under Settings —> Users —> Security ."

2896181682,118169,8812330450,message,2025-04-10T01:37:26Z,christine@zamp.com,"Hi Patrick, Thank you for your patience, while I connected with our filing team regarding the $0 returns. They confirmed that if you had no sales after the February 2025 returns were filed, then you can contact the states in which you are filing monthly returns and close out the accounts as of 2/28. On the spreadsheet you provided, there were 26 states you said were $0 filings and you were going to close out. Out of these 26, all of the states were monthly except for New Jersey. We are showing that New Jersey has a quarterly filing. We recommend filing one last return here for the quarter, and then you can contact the state to close out the sales tax account. Our team also confirmed that we can mark New York as the final return. In order to close out the account for New York, you'll still need to contact the state after the final return has been filed. Regarding the payment for the Zamp services, if you prefer to wire transfer you can do this in one transaction. Currently, there are 2 invoices due for the amount of $4,032.22 so the total payment that we need you to wire is $8,064.44. Attached are the wire instructions. Please reach out if I can be of further assistance. Thanks, Christine"

Can you please review the below email chain and attachments and let me know if this makes sense to you and if it changes anything for the approach to March transactions? Sure! I reviewed the email thread, and I think it makes sense. That said, the screenshot the CT of Nisolo shared appears to be from Shopify's newer reporting/analytics tooling (ShopifyQL). At the same time, it should be accurate. That is one area we're less familiar with, although we're learning more as we can. Zamp's Shopify integration depends upon the Shopify API instead of Shopify's reporting for sales tax details, which we're more familiar with. If you'd like to take the 'Taxes' amount as the source of truth here, it would change our approach, and we'll need to import some additional transactions to arrive at the higher amount. This seems like a more accurate path overall."

Yes, I just imported the last file into the Nisolo Zamp account and will send you a tax-due estimate within the next 2 hours; I'm allowing time to ensure our background tax-engine processes have been completed. I've attached the files I used to import the sales data into Zamp. A couple of items to note: The variance between the raw transaction data and the amounts you estimated were still owed was likely due to refunds and partial refunds. At the same time, Zamp can use the data provided to account for full refunds; there wasn't a way to account for partial refunds as we don't know how much tax was refunded. Partial refunds are something that Shopify has limitations on anyway. The transactions we imported will arrive at the expected unpaid past taxes. Please let us know if you have any questions."

I've reviewed the data and various situations involved across all states. I have enough data and information here to work with. I'm getting the data into Zamp's template and importing it into Zamp. Once that's resolved, I'll send an estimate for your review and approval before filing. This should be sent to you tonight but may be tomorrow morning."

Chris, any updates/questions on your end as you review the info? I know we are on a tight deadline to ensure these are all filed on time for March transactions! Also, Christine, I spoke with Matt, and he has a follow up question for you he'll be reaching out to you about re: whether or not we need to file $0 returns in certain states (rather than no action by Zamp), and also will connect with you re: the outstanding invoices. Please all note that I have taken the steps to pay for the March invoice via Stripe, but it is saying to do an ACH charge it will take 1-2 business days. Attached are the screenshots on what Stripe sent back, and I'll let you know once I'm able to confirm and process the payment via our bank once the code is sent from Stripe that's referred to. Again, may be much easier/faster to send a wire transfer, so if it would be possible for the Finance team to provide that info, I'd be happy to send a wire today! Thank you! Patrick"

2896181682,118169,8802733252,note,2025-04-07T16:02:02Z,christine@zamp.com,@chris more info from Patrick. We had a call today. I really could only answer his question about closing the states. He was also running through the data but I let him know that you'd have to review to make sure you had everything you need. I have a recording of the call if you want to review in case the explanation he provided here isn't clear. Let me know if you want me to reach out to him if there's more info needed. I'll reach out to filing about submitting the final return in NY for this March return.
2896181682,118169,8802716075,customer,2025-04-07T15:50:50Z,patrick@nisolo.com,"Christine, Chris, & Team,

Good morning and happy Monday! I am following up with a few important updates for Zamp related to the tax filings for March transactions. Here are important updates: Now that I understand that Zamp cannot close states for Nisolo, I've updated the ""Actions Needed by Zamp"" direction by state in column D of the attached spreadsheet, titled ""4.7.25 Update to 4.2.25 Copy March Transactions Zamp Nisolo Follow Up Direction By State"" and the updates can be seen on the ""2.0 Revised…"" tab. There are 10 states that we need for Zamp to take action on. These 10 states are listed at the top of the ""2.0 Revised…"" tab in the spreadsheet. Reuben & I will focus on closing all of the others in green without Zamp support given Zamp cannot help close the states. For the 5 states that need past taxes paid for, refer to the tab ""Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" for the total amount owed in each state. Also, note that the ""Order Data"" requested by Chris for each state for the relevant time ranges where we found past collected tax have all been attached to this email as hard copies, which show the orders within each individual state. Also attached to this email is a spreadsheet that shows all historical sales and taxes collected by month by year for each state (this is the sales data, not the individual orders) I tried to highlight on each tab in teal any states where there was unpaid, collected tax, and I do not think you'll need this spreadsheet. However, note that the ""Prior tax to be paid"" in column B on the ""Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" tab of the ""4.7.25 Update…"" spreadsheet corresponds with the data from the ""Shopify Sales by Month 2019 by Shipping Region sales_2019-01-01_2019-12-31 (1)"" spreadsheet. This data in Column B is what we want to make sure gets paid by state in the March transaction filings. Note, there is a discrepancy between the totals in that spreadsheet vs. what you would find in each individual state (order data) spreadsheets, I believe bc one set of tax is Net of Returns and the other is Gross of Returns. For further clarity on the discrepancy, please note the following, which is also outlined on the """"Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" tab: Even though the date range used is the exact same, there is a discrepancy in total tax owed (Ex Nevada $12K vs. $18K) in the individual state spreadsheet data of ""Orders"" (column E or see hardcopy) vs. the (Column D or hardcopy) ""Shopify Sales by Month 2019 by Shipping Region sales_2019-01-01_2019-12-31 (1)"" file, we believe because Column E ""Orders"" is GROSS of returns but the other Column D is Net of returns. Nisolo has had around a 25-30% Return rate historically. Again, the spreadsheet hosting only the individual state's info (column E or in hardcopy) is GROSS of returns, and returns have not been taken out, and therefore tax is higher. Again, the ""Shopify Sales by Month"" spreadsheet (Column D or hardcopy) is Net sales with tax NET of returns, and therefore is the more accurate reading of tax owed that needs to be paid. Chris, once you have a chance to review this material, please let me know if you have any questions or if this gives you all that you need for Zamp to ensure the past collected tax gets filed on time for March transactions so that we can pay it and close the states on time. Thank you! Patrick"

I totally understand, as I used to forget about the WA B&O frequently, and I still occasionally get mixed up with New York's fiscal-year-based annual/quarterly filing periods. :) Regarding CA, on our end, we're showing that the amount due is close to the amount of tax collected throughout March 2025 because Zamp made monthly prepayments for the amounts noted below, and the total estimated tax collected was $1,839.00 . First prepayment: $590.20 . Second prepayment: $632.74 . Total: $1,222.94. I hope this helps! Do we have your approval to proceed with filings this month?"

The California tax-due estimate likely aligns with the tax amount due after accounting for the January and February 2025 prepayments; the remainder should be tied into March 2025 tax collection. We'll confirm this, though! For Washington, that tax-due estimate is higher because WA also has a Business & Occupation tax due when filing sales tax returns. This gross receipts tax is not collected from customers and is calculated at a rate of 0.471%. The B&O tax amount estimate is $38.80. We'll follow up about CA as soon as we're able!"

Once we've imported this data, we'll share an updated tax due estimate, as it appears (per this article) that Eventbrite should at least be remitting the Texas sales tax collected as a marketplace facilitator. We'll do some further research to confirm. We'll follow up separately regarding your questions about the tax due estimate and Shopify differences. Have a great evening!"

A quick question: Do you happen to have the addresses for these events and tickets sold through Eventbrite? We can use the 'Event Location' and Google the address, but we want to be confident we're using the correct address when importing sales data like this into Zamp. After some research, Eventbrite is likely collecting and remitting the tax as a Marketplace Facilitator, but this may not apply to some of the sales data you shared (if the event occurred in Los Angeles, CA, or New York, NY). However, we'll still want to import this data and ensure the filing/reporting correctly deducts these values."

On the Shopify transactions, can you please clarify how that works with Shopify now remitting some of the taxes for us? It looks like they may not be remitting all of it? Sure! To our understanding, Shopify is now remitting any taxes collected through the 'SHOP' channel, which is tied into a specific payment method and marketplace via the Shop app (I believe this is an Android and iPhone app). They won't remit taxes collected from an order placed on BetterWild's website. This means that shop payments or channel orders can still come through with tax that BetterWild would need to remit via Zamp's filings. A way to see this could be using this Shopify report and adding a filter for 'Filed' under 'Filed by channel' like this: How are you handling those transactions? Our Engineering Team has already implemented measures to account for Marketplace sales through Shopify Shop. You will not be remitting taxes that Shopify has already remitted. Our Shopify integration can detect this when your store's transactions sync with Zamp. Zamp will then file the sales tax returns associated with the other transactions. I hope this helps!"

We performed a deep dive review after making the partial refunds and order edits adjustments within Zamp. We also allowed time for Zamp and Shopify amounts to be updated (Shopify appears to have reports up-to-date by or around the 5th of each month, maybe earlier).

I am sharing the comparison file I used during our call in case it's helpful to reference later; I've also updated it to be clearer. Ultimately, the differences were likely due to some updates or items in process on Shopify's side. Zamp aligned closely with Shopify's amounts once Shopify's various updates or processes were completed, within 1.16%. I'll make sure to reach out to you separately about the May 2025 filings as soon as the partial refunds have been adjusted.

We're aligned that we don't want you all to pay too little or too much tax. Some of the differences here are due to the time zones used in Shopify and Zamp, which I'll walk you through on our call. We have several solutions in place for these situations in the future, and I have another method to ensure the correct tax amount is remitted."

If we continue to have these issues then we will have to switch back to our previous tax provider, because we are filing a lot more then the taxes we collected which is causing us $5-$10K differences which is a lot of extra money we are paying for taxes and this is causing our team a lot of effort and time."

Can we deduct those extra numbers for May? Yes, once we've confirmed the exact difference and its various causes, we can discuss several different approaches to adjusting for it. We're currently evaluating a few potential causes of the difference, which are: Time zones are likely the biggest culprit, and we share more information here . When expanding the Shopify US Taxes Report date range, the tax amounts are higher than what Zamp estimated was due. I'm working on a transaction-by-transaction comparison between Shopify and Zamp to find the transactions that fall into this category and their tax amount. Refund transactions causing a state's local jurisdiction's tax balance to be less than $0 (or a negative amount). I look forward to our call for next week and getting this completely sorted out!"

Yes, Zamp filed for April 2025 after we didn't hear back from our emails on 5/7. That said, we've been working to determine why there is a difference here after we went through the process you and I discussed earlier in the month, which appears to be related to refunds. We have some strategies we can use to account for this if the differences are due to refunds or another item, in future filing periods. We'll have more details (For sure) by tomorrow, as we had some unexpected delays on our side. We can schedule a call for later in the day (EST) tomorrow to allow time for the investigation to be completed or next week."

Regarding the partial refunds and manually edited orders: Starting this month (or soon), for the filings that will be processed in June, we discussed using a CSV template (imported into Google Sheets) that follows Zamp's import template (attached). We will share how to prepare that file in this article . For the April 2025 transactions, I'll run our ""forced"" Shopify reconciliation script. Regarding editing orders within Loop instead of Shopify: This change would likely involve multiple pieces, and I hope the information below is helpful. Here are some Loop resources that I found about this, and it may be worth triple-checking for best practices from the Loop Support Team: Create a Return for a Customer Return Policy Settings Variant Exchange Different Priced Exchanges Advanced Exchanges Regarding outstanding state-specific items: I've also contacted Amelia about the outstanding items for any remaining states. While researching it a bit, I found that Amelia shared these outstanding items on 4/8/25 at 9:53 AM EST and followed up on 4/28/25 at 12:41 PM EST; the subject of that email was ' Re: Onboarding Call Follow up with Zamp '. I'm sharing this if it helps find the email, but Amelia will follow up as soon as possible. Here's what Amelia shared. I recommend directing any registration/account/state questions about this to Amelia or onboarding@zamp.com (if you have questions before Amelia reaches out). Great! Here is the list of states, contact details, and what we need to be able to file. Missouri - We still need to get the responsible party date of birth and ssn/itin of the person used at the time of registering in Missouri. 573-751-5860 North Carolina- Since there is no apparent registration id number outside of the SST number, you will need to call the state so they can advise steps needed - is the account is still open, next steps based on your current status, etc. You can ask them what is required by you to start filing online via non-SST or if a new registration is needed. NC contact number- 877-252-3052 Nevada- Since the login provided is not the master account login, you will need to call the state and they can advise/update the access to ensure your login is set as an administrator. Nevada contact number - 866-962-3707 Please let me know if you need any clarifications or have any questions on this. Please let me know if you or your team have any questions about the Loop Discount or the other items we discussed. We are aiming to have a tax-due estimate sent your way by Monday or Tuesday next week, after adjusting for the Shopify variances. Have a wonderful weekend!"
2893767258,117134,8892814699,note,2025-05-02T19:42:43Z,chris@zamp.com,"Notes: Causes of the differences: They don't have the loop discount turned on. They manually edit orders if a customer calls or emails in, but they don't do that in Loop; it's within Shopify. They sometimes issue partial refunds for issues, discounts, promos, leaving reviews, etc., which ties into Shopify's limitations around partial refunds, which do not account for tax. They already track order edits and partial refunds internally, and can ask the team to enter that into a CSV or in a way that it can be put into a CSV (A Google Sheet most likely.) Henry will: Ask about: loop discount editing orders in Loop This is a process change that will take some time. Tracking partial refunds. The above items will likely start this month for filing in June. For the April 2025 filing, we'll use the Shopify forced reconciliation script. My action items: Ask Amelia to give Henry an update and ask for any action items. Send the CSV article and template, for order edit and partial refunds to be shared with Zamp (for May and onward, until Zamp engineering has something in place and/or the Mod Lighting Team can edit orders in Loop."

Investigate the Shopify basic script - it uses a billing address instead of a shipping address. order id #CE1244X Upload Eventbrite - Q2 2025 - for TX. Amazon - pull those reports and import Q1 25 into Q2 25 for TX — If Shopify basic can't happen, can we import a CSV of just the tax transactions for Chakaruna."

I just sent out a calendar invite for 9:00 AM CST (10:00 AM EST for me), as I'm available from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM CST, and later in the day. During our call, we'll talk about the next steps to move forward. To help determine this, it would be helpful to log into your Amazon account during the call. Our Amazon sales data imports aren't showing any transactions for Q1 2025, which will help us verify what's happening here."

Aside from the two previously missing Shopify transactions, we found that there were some slight variances between Zamp's tax collected and Shopify's due to the manual workaround method we used here. Outside of the above, the difference was caused by the two missing transactions and what appears to be some rounding in Shopify's US tax reporting. Would you have time to discuss this and the plan to resolve it as we move forward next week?"
2893766265,117127,8840263638,message,2025-04-18T02:46:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Jessica, You're welcome! Regarding the variance between Shopify and Zamp: We're still reviewing some Shopify reports, such as the Q1 2025 Texas Transactions Report , to determine why this difference exists. Part of what we've discovered happened here is that when we used the manual workaround method to import your Shopify data, the two transactions below were missed. CE1005X CE1004X We're still working through comparing the tax amounts between transactions in Zamp and transactions in Shopify to find the remaining difference. This is a piece that should be confirmed by tomorrow. This situation is something that we will help correct and ensure doesn't happen again in the future. If you have some time sometime soon, we'd be happy to hop on a call to talk about this and the path to resolving it. Regarding the Eventbrite transactions: This part of the import process was missed, and we've already taken steps to ensure it doesn't happen again, including adding additional reminders on our end. The good news here is that Eventbrite, as a marketplace , remits the taxes it collects to the state of Texas and other states listed in their article here . This means that while we do still want to import these transactions and report the gross sales to TX , your business doesn't need to remit the tax (Zamp includes this as a 'Marketplace Facilitator deduction' on filings.) When we create these kinds of transactions in Zamp, we do so with $0 tax collected to ensure Dandy Lion doesn't pay the tax twice. Regarding the Amazon transactions: I've found that Amazon transactions did not sync over to Zamp, but I've been unable to find any errors associated with this issue. I'm checking in with Amelia about a couple of items here in the morning. We can take an approach of having our team manually download these transactions each month to ensure they are accounted for as Marketplace Facilitator transactions, similar to Eventbrite. For Amazon and Eventbrite transactions, we can include them in a future filing, such as the Q2 2025 tax filing. We're also happy to discuss this on a call if you'd prefer. We're here to help resolve this and ensure Dandy Lion is compliant; fix these data situations."

We understand where you're coming from with this and will be sure to improve. We're also happy to hop on a call to discuss this, after we've confirmed what happened. The reason this was a one-time exception and the cause of the difference is related to the email Amelia sent out a bit ago regarding your Shopify store's Shopify subscription and recent limitations implemented by Shopify. The Shopify changes caused Zamp to be unable to import all of your Shopify transactions, so we imported them manually using a workaround. I'm re-investigating the differences between the Shopify report and Zamp; I am also investigating what happened with the Eventbrite sales and Amazon sales. Please note that Amazon and Eventbrite both collect and remit (file) sales taxes in Texas and many other states as a Marketplace Facilitator. Meaning—those taxes are already paid to the state, and Dandy Lion LLC won't need to pay those taxes to the state, but each state (including TX) has reporting requirements for sellers. We share more information in this guide . I'll have an update for you about this today!"

I'm also concerned that it has taken 16 days to receive such a vague answer as to why your tax due report differs from the Shopify report, especially since it still doesn't match even after you stated that you manually imported the Q1 transactions. If you manually imported the Q1 transactions, it seems to me that your tax due amount should match the Shopify report. Could you please explain why it does not? Additionally, after reviewing the dashboard, I do not see any Eventbrite or Amazon transactions listed in the transaction tab. Have these transactions been accounted for, and what is the tax due for these transactions?

I'd like assistance in formulating a response to the customer regarding the discrepancy they've observed between their filing and the Shopify report. The difference is less than 1%, and this can largely be attributed to rounding and time zones. I’ve also identified that the customer uses the Order Editing app, which will necessitate further investigation on our part. To ensure appropriate handling of this matter, I intend to focus my initial response on the rounding/timezone issue, deferring discussion regarding the third-party app until an alignment with Chris.

We're still investigating these differences, and I will rerun some reports from Shopify on Monday to see if anything changed and compare some pieces of the puzzle at the transaction level. So far, the main difference is related to California. A few questions: 1) Does the DT Ecom team use any third-party Shopify apps that allow orders to be edited after they are placed and before fulfillment? 2) If third-party apps aren't used for order editing, does that ever occur manually by your team? 3) Do you know if any of the third-party apps within your Shopify store create orders/transactions within Shopify for returns or exchanges? Does the Redo returns app allow this? We've seen this kind of behavior within Shopify when AfterShip or Loop are used; Redo is one app we haven't run into yet. Have a wonderful weekend!"

A colleague and I investigated this situation and found the following details; please let us know if you have any questions. Regarding the more minor differences: Zamp's tax-due estimate aligns closely with Shopify's US Sales Tax report when adjusting for time zones, timely filing discounts, state-specific rounding, etc; these variances are usually below 5%. The amounts in this Shopify US Sales Tax Report differ from the original list for various states. If you used this Report previously, it's possible it wasn't yet up-to-date, as I'm unsure how often these reports update in Shopify. In general, the differences noted here are mainly due to Zamp's adjustments to file based on each state's specific time zone, while Shopify uses a single time zone. In our article here , we discuss more of the differences noted above and other common differences between Zamp and Shopify. When I filter the Shopify US Sales Tax Report for the states filed monthly and then separately for the states filed quarterly while expanding the date range and summing the tax totals, it is within $78 of Zamp's estimate. Regarding Texas: The above includes Texas because the Shopify US Sales Tax report for TX and an example of the time zone differences here is the order noted below. When adjusting for the CST time zone, Order ID OB48264 in Zamp is reported as 3/1/25, but in Shopify, it's listed with a date of 2/28/25. The Shopify US Sales Tax report shows $1,075.59 in tax collected, which is $63.84 less than Zamp's total, which was recently updated to 1,139.43 (or 5.94%). We couldn't find any missing or extra transactions, and the tax amounts aligned with Shopify. I've also attached an export of the transactions Zamp is using to determine the tax due. I hope this is helpful to you. Please let us know if you have any questions. We'll need to move the filings along into the process by the end of the day tomorrow, April 15th, 2025 , to file by the state's due dates and avoid any penalties and interest. Do you approve of proceeding with One Bed's filings this month?"

Regarding California: Yes—this is happening because Zamp's understanding per One Bed's CA sales tax registration is that the filing frequency is what we call 'Quarterly Prepay,' which aligns with CA's pay monthly and file quarterly filing frequency. This does equal the monthly sales tax due in most scenarios, and we hope to improve our tax-due estimates in the future. We'll triple-check this and share that confirmation in our follow-up. Regarding the large difference you noted for Texas: This is interesting to hear. I have a few questions to help us understand why there is such a difference and the potential causes. 1) Does One Bed use third-party apps for returns/exchanges, such as Loop? 2) Does One Bed use third-party apps to allow customers to edit their orders after placing them? Is that done manually by the One Bed Team or at all? 3) Could you please confirm by sharing a screenshot or an export of the Shopify Report that you're reviewing and comparing against Zamp? 4) When you have a moment, could you please share One Bed's Collaborator request code with us?

I escalated to QBO dev team because we have properly set up items in QBO at the customer level (exempt) and also at the product level, classifying these as bakery items.

We are experiencing an issue with QBO calculating sales tax on some invoices for The Vitamin Shoppe orders. The customer is correctly set up in QBO as tax-exempt (they are a reseller).

The customer address. A few questions here: 1) Was the invoice recently updated, such as changing the shipping address? 2) What is the invoice number?

Regarding California: This Fortunate One difference is similar to Hello Molly. This difference happens because Fortunate One makes monthly prepayments to CA and a quarterly filing (a quarterly prepay filing frequency). Here's a breakdown of this for Fortunate One: The January 2025 prepayment was $2,964.38 . The February 2025 prepayment was $4,161.28 . Total prepayments: $7,125.66 . Remaining tax-due estimate: $7,030.88 Combined total: $14,156.54 . Regarding the remaining states brought up here: The following states have different filing frequencies that are either annual or a non-standard quarter: Indiana has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. Nebraska has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. New York has a quarterly filing frequency, but this is within the fiscal quarter date range , so the next return is the NY Q1 2025 return, due in June 2025. Texas: To our understanding, Fortunate One is not currently registered for a sales tax permit or account in Texas. It's possible that the tax was accidentally collected within Shopify if someone accidentally turned it on previously. Still, it does not appear to be enabled currently, as we do not see any tax collection in TX. We'd recommend refunding the tax to the customer if tax were accidentally collected. This can happen when tax is collected on an order, and the address is later changed. If you know the Order ID associated with that order, we can investigate it further within Zamp. We've seen this happen with other companies we work with ( this Shopify community thread has some details), but we do not currently know a solution. We'd recommend that you check with Shopify support about the options here. A follow-up question: Considering the details noted above, do you know if we have your approval to proceed with Fortunate One's filings this month? Once you're ready for us to file, you can also click the blue ' Review & approve filings ' button. Otherwise and if we don't hear back about this, we'll resume filing by Thursday, April 10th, 2025 , to ensure timely filings. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Additional states: Indiana has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. Nebraska has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. New York is quarterly with a fiscal quarter date range, so the next return is the NY Q1 2025 return, which is due in June 2025. Texas—On Zamp's side, Texas was not included because we understand that Fortunate One is not registered to collect sales taxes in Texas. This can happen with Shopify orders if the address is changed after the order is placed or if tax collection was accidentally turned on for TX at some point."

For the states where we have sales tax, can you please confirm that those states tax sales of food products? Of course! So that you know, the taxability of food will vary from state to state and from one product category (type/tax code) to another. To our understanding, the 'Nutrition Bars' category would be taxed in all those states except for those noted below. Washington D.C. —This is a small amount, and it could be leftover from the various product category changes you have been working on. Vermont —This is a small amount that could be related to the items noted for DC (above). Washington —The tax estimate here is mainly due to WA's Business & Occupation tax , a gross receipts tax not collected from customers but due when filing a sales tax return; the remainder could be similar to the two states noted above. The WA B&O tax amount is $461.35. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

VA notice: System failed to calculate 1 transaction(s) totaling $118.91, so they were excluded. One transaction was missing: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clr6g73v20006a8lippj6yh3a/transactions?date=2025-03-01%7E2025-03-31&shipToState=VA&limit=100 .

These NC transactions had the right amount of tax collected: 6538249 - 6594902 The rest of them had under collection that appeared to include only the state rate of 4.75%. Sean will check with the business owner to see if they want to pay the under-collected tax out of pocket; he'll follow up to let us know. I'm providing Sean with the under-collected NC Transactions so that he can contact their rep at GameFound (their sales platform) to see what can be done about this moving forward."

We've been investigating this and have found that it appears related to how the CSV was imported and how Zamp ensures only the tax collected is filed. We still have a few items to investigate and test, but it is best to schedule a call sometime next week to discuss this further. I hope that you have a great weekend!"
2893739546,116922,8938170518,note,2025-05-16T14:58:09Z,landrade@zamp.com,"@chris I'm working on it and want to share my findings and thoughts. There is no difference between the customer file and Zamp transactions. I believe the variance is related to the magic math. CSVs comparison There is no difference in the tax total, subtotal, and transaction total between the customer CSV file and the transactions in Zamp. I noticed some inconsistencies in some shipping states. When comparing either CustomerSubLocationIsoCode or ShippingSubLocationIsoCode from the customer file to the shiptoState from Zamp, a few of them don't match. However, they have the same zip code in both files, so I believe we're fine in terms of reporting. Magic Math When checking the variance review export and filtering by sectionName equal to 'General State' (the filing section where the gross sales were reduced), we see the exact amount used to file in the taxableAmount (NC = 2987.37) Question: Why was the gross sales amount reduced, but the tax due/ collected remains the same?"

For example, when I filter the March CSV I sent to North Carolina and look at the column sums, there's 3550 collected for product, 730 for shipping, and 210.91 for taxes. When I look at the North Carolina return filed, it shows 2,987.37 gross receipts. I would have expected a higher number derived from the preceding numbers. Can you explain how this works out?"

So there's no way to retroactively find the date of the transaction being finalized. So what I'm doing is running the gamefound report on the last day of the month. When I run the one for April, it will also include everything for March. Which means I'll have to reverse out all the March activity from the April report based on what I recognize in March before I send it to you. It's a pretty big hassle, but BackerKit worked the same way! So I think I would just date everything for the last day of the month, unless you see a reason to do it differently."

We will get the WV invoice 11490 voided, as that will be faster on our end (instead of waiting for a delete request), and that should allow me to send you the updated amounts tonight. Regarding Washington: The difference here is due to WA's B&O tax . The B&O Retailing tax is $870.21 for Q1 2025, including the possible duplicate invoice 11328. Once we remove invoice 11328, the B&O tax amount will decrease because it is a gross receipts tax calculated by multiplying the Gross Sales by 0.471%. After removing this duplicate invoice, a rough estimate shows that the B&O tax should be about $465.41 , and the overall tax should be closer to an estimate of $10,823.47. Considering the above, should we void or delete WA invoice 11328?"

I believe I found the issue, and it appears that this may be related to two deleted invoices as that no longer exist in QuickBooks Online: For West Virginia , we have an invoice 11490 in Zamp that no longer appears in QBO with a tax amount of $193.11. For Washington , we have invoice 11328 in Zamp that no longer appears in QBO. Its tax amount is $7,742.08, and it appears to be a duplicate of invoice 11444 . I've attached an XLSX file showing the exports from Zamp and their comparisons to see if the invoice number exists in the QBO export and if there are any differences in the tax collected. The tax collected amounts match, within reason for rounding, but two Zamp invoices appear ""extra."" Do you think we should ask our engineering team to proceed with deleting invoices 11490 and 11328?"

I'm working on sorting this out now and was hoping to have the numbers over to you after finding the root cause/fixing them.

I've reviewed all of KC Consolidated LLC's filings with Zamp and can't find an amount matching this. The closest is a filing for South Dakota with a tax-due amount of $773.51. From my experience, it's rare for a sales tax return payment to be a flat $750. The closest amount I could find to this for any recent filings was the Maryland February 2025 filing filed on 3/3/25 for $754.65. To ensure we're on the same page, is the date associated with this payment this month (April) or last month (3/8/25)?"

We're both pretty busy, and I'm glad we are on the same page. We appreciate your patience while we worked through some technical hiccups (unrelated to this situation) yesterday and today. This makes sense to me, and after digging into QuickBooks Online's various articles and forums further, I'm seeing what you're saying and found the pattern where it appears currency conversions don't always work with foreign amounts, etc. Can we include the 'Exchange Rate' available in this custom QBO Report export and utilize that as a temporary workaround for part of the process? Our upcoming significant QBO integration release will help resolve much of this and increase accuracy. I've attached a file as an example. The exchange rate is usually 1.34 or 1.35 in this file. We would do this after filtering out non-US 'Bill To' addresses. I'm still happy to have a call to discuss this or any filing/data/QBO-related questions you might have. I'll be around until ~8:00 PM EST today, and have quite a bit of availability next week."

I hope you're doing well! Thanks for your patience.

To answer your questions: 1) We do have a small batch of US customers who actually do request to be billed in CAD. Oftentimes it has to do with three reasons: (1) they have a Canadian CPA employee, or (2) they hold some CAD for FX hedging. Unfortunately, those ones won't have a USD amount inherently - the two possible solutions here would just be to: Accept that the foreign amount is in CAD but just say it's in USD for nexus analysis - it's such a small batch of customers with small amounts that if that's the reason we hit nexus we were going to hit nexus next month Find an average FX rate to convert them at in order to get to the final amount 2) The foreign amount in Quickbooks is the amount in the invoice currency (so typically a US customer's foreign amount will be in USD). Now here's the issue - the tax amount and the net amount are ALWAYS in CAD in Quickbooks and we haven't identified a field that shows those amounts in the invoice currency.

Let me know if you wanna hop on a call to find a workaround or discuss any of this as tomorrow we can definitely make some time!

Cheers,

Bill"

I've confirmed we have access to LumiQ's QBO account, and I've created a Zamp Sales Tax custom report . I've asked our engineering team to remove all automatically synced transactions that use the shipping address, and the team I'm part of will manually import this data for now. A couple of quick questions here: 1) I found some invoices with a 'CAD' currency that have billing addresses within the US. Should we ignore those invoices, or is there a way (that you know of) to export them in USD from QuickBooks Online (QBO)? 2) How are the foreign amount, tax, and net amounts configured within QBO? Which one should be the USD amount? I read through this QBO support forum thread , which makes sense. So, the invoices with a CAD currency and amount/foreign amounts that are the same may have been issued in CAD. My goal here is to ensure an accurate and scalable solution in the long term for filing LumiQ's US state sales tax returns accurately. We're almost there!

Yes, I'm positive it's related to negative amounts in specific jurisdictions because the negative amounts line up with the differences. This scenario can happen anytime the two conditions below are met, and my understanding is that Zamp has behaved this way the whole time (with slight adjustments over the last year, possibly.) In these cases, an item is purchased in one month (January) and returned the following month (February, still within a 14-day or 30-day window). There aren't any other sales to that specific jurisdiction in the following month to fully cover the refund, or there are no sales to that particular jurisdiction. On our side, the transaction export is used to build the filing team's summary totals, but that summary is different; it's a state-specific sales tax internal report used to file the returns. I'm pulling data from the same source. This could also be occurring more often because we're adjusting for edited orders, voided transactions, and items that cause refunds across multiple jurisdictions. These are the Order IDs causing the negative amounts in local jurisdictions: #23832930 #23828180 #23837460 #23830180 #23834760 #23832720 #23836330 #23833050 #23822770 #23821470 #23830810 REF-6115898589436 #23835120 #23832520 #23837570 I hope this helps!"
2876711998,111998,8734137236,customer,2025-03-17T16:41:23Z,jason@shopravella.com,"Hi Chris, Yes I'm surprised we had these come up again. I thought it would be just from January because of the higher amount of returns from December orders, combined with a seasonal drop off into January. We're definitely sure it's related to the negative amounts for specific jurisdictions right? Because I don't recall this happening at all last year, but now we've had 2 months with this issue. It seems either our transaction list export is missing something, or the filing team's calculation is being done differently this year. Form what I remember last year, the excel transaction list was usually more of an 'export' of the filing team's summary -- and so the numbers would generally match since it was from the same 'source'. Now it seems our transaction export and the filing team's summary totals are from a slightly different 'source', but with the 2 sources. Thanks, Jason"

We still have some to recover from last month's filings, and we can include these additional refunds. We do have a process in place for this. Suppose this pattern continues and the list grows. In that case, we'll want to set some time aside to discuss determining a threshold for handling these refund scenarios based on the materiality of the amount. I'll approve the filings to get them moving along. Have a great week!"

After completing the investigation, I've found that all variances where the estimated tax due variance amount is above 5% are related to refunds causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions within a state. This is the primary cause for CA, CO, GA, and TN. This means that some refunds in the export I shared with you could not be accounted for because, according to the various states' rules (as noted during previous discussions/calls), we cannot file negative amounts in any state jurisdiction. For Texas, due to the low percent difference (~2.13%) and ruling out refunds in local jurisdictions as the cause, that difference is very likely related to rounding at the line item level (per transaction) when summing values for local jurisdictions. It's also possible that I'm unaware of other state-specific logic in place. I hope this is helpful. Do you know if we can proceed with the filings this month?"

I'm re-running some background processes and giving them extra time to complete in case there's something ""stuck""/processing on the tax engine or database side. That said, a mix of the differences here could be due to refunds causing negative balances in local jurisdictions paired with state-specific rounding (e.g., IL and TN round to even dollar amounts on their filings). I may have another update tonight, but I hope to have this sorted out or confirmed by Monday. Our filing team is aware of the situation and noted that, as an exception, we'll still be able to file on Monday on time. Additionally, due to a recent improvement by our engineering team regarding time zones and transaction dates, I found a better way to export the data for the states we're filing for Ravella.

Smaller excess amounts for others such as AZ, ILK, MA as well. Can we check CA and GA, and possibly CO, NC and TN again? Thanks, Jason"

We've accounted for the refunds from January 2025 that needed to be carried forward and that information is tracked in this Google Sheet (you both should have access.) I've also attached a couple of files: An export of Ravella's transactions within Zamp for February 2025 and NY Q4 2024. I attempted to manually adjust this file for time zones by state as we're still waiting for the internal improvements to make this filtering more straightforward, and there were various database limitations at the time. The above means I could have missed something, but the amounts are close to what we share in the tax-due estimate (accounting for rounding, timely filing discounts, etc.) The Shopify Export with my adjustments for the order edit and voided order scenarios. I followed the same process as previous months, and triple-checked the work. We had previously adjusted for NY December 2024 and January 2025, those are included in the export noted in #1. With additional process and app improvements (our database migration and updates are more than 50% complete) and growth within the Technical Success Team, we aim to have these details over to you much earlier in April.

We found a way to temporarily adjust to account for the order edit situation and other factors that could lead to your noted differences. We're still fine-tuning this method, but we have surfaced it for our engineering team to explore as a solution to force reconciliation between Zamp and Shopify. I've attached a file showing the tax amounts from Shopify and Zamp; this was used to determine the adjustments needed. We adjusted for the amounts by the difference noted in column F. The variance is slight enough to be related to time zones, rounding, and other state-specific causes; we share more details here . One essential point is that we discovered Shopify's US Sales Tax report does not include tax on shipping (' total_shipping_tax_amount ') in the ' total_item_tax_amount ' column. Shopify's reporting separately buckets shipping and item taxes; this article shares more details . This also means that the variance is a lower tax amount. As we discussed, we still plan to evaluate previous filing periods (including January 2025) and determine the best path forward for making those adjustments. This will start tomorrow and continue into next week. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

It's one of the complexities of sales tax: adjusting for state changes and improving the app to handle all of the changes (including changes that other state's don't require.) Have a great week!"

2876024145,111750,8735678513,message,2025-03-18T01:09:18Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Kathleen, Here's another update! Our engineering team found that the LA issue for Leadwork, Dialect, and Database was related to a summary issue on our end due to a way LA changed reporting requirements for digital goods/services. They pushed an improvement out to resolve this, and now the tax-due estimates for LA match the expectations for February 2025. This also sheds some light on why it seemed only to affect Batch Services. Here are the updated amounts for the LA February 2025 filings: Leadwork - $543.24. Dialect - $146.10. Database - $81.70 Due to the timing and the approaching state deadline, I've approved the LA filings for all three companies."

Not just yet, but our engineering team noted they're looking into this, and I've escalated the priority as high as it can go. Once I know more, I'll update you right away! Also we received invitations to our companies again, not sure why. Yep! Those emails went out because Zamp recently released a major improvement that will allow a single login for multiple companies within Zamp and a multi-user login. Once you accept all of those invites, you'll be able to log in to see each company instead of having four different logins :)"

We have filed some LA returns, and those customers didn't have this scenario occurring. Ashley and I also spot-checked some other LA filings and didn't find this occurring for those customers. So far, this may be limited to the Batch Services accounts. This is on our engineering team's radar; they're juggling several things. I'll let our filing team know that we can release everything except for LA, for now."

This additional observation about the first 7 days of February LA tax is interesting. From what I can tell, all transactions are included in the various database pieces. Also, I realized last night that a piece of the generated filing is missing the state-level tax calculations (which I've never seen happen before). This could be related to our recent database migration and backed-up processing queues, so I escalated this to our engineering team. If this is related, surfacing this will help us prevent this from happening. Also, some upcoming after-filing March 2025 database improvements should resolve this entirely. Our engineering team has prioritized this and will update you as soon as we know more."

2876024145,111750,8727085162,customer,2025-03-14T16:02:00Z,kathleen.far@batchservice.com,Thanks. It just seemed odd that the Dialect variance equaled exactly the same amount that was the Database amount. So that makes the issue even odder.

2876024145,111750,8724295255,customer,2025-03-13T23:31:45Z,kathleen.far@batchservice.com,I have a thought on LA for Dialect. Is it possible that the Database transactions were uploaded to the Dialect account along with the Dialect transactions. The Dialect difference is exactly what the Database amount should be. It doesn't solve the Database variance but it helps solve the Dialect issue.

2874366367,111009,8722727485,message,2025-03-13T15:57:53Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Allison, Thanks for your patience here! We investigated this further and found that the difference is related to the three reasons, noted below. The reasons are: 17 SplitOrder transactions from September 2024 through December 2024 were not previously adjusted for and were brought into the February 2025 filing period to assist in recovering the tax for those transactions. This was for a total of -$59.11 . 19 SplitOrder transactions occurred on 2/1/2025 which were included in the January 2025 filing in February because Zamp adjusts for the state-specific timezone in our filings. These adjustments were brought into the February 2025 filing period to ensure the SplitOrders were accounted for. This was a total of -$57.28 . Depending on the state, the remaining difference is likely related to timezone adjustments of 2/28/2025 through 3/1/2025. This typically accounts for 1-2% of a variance between Zamp and Shopify with tax collected. This would account for the remaining $21.33 difference. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

This month's filings for the February 2025 period include all Split Order adjustments like we handled in February for January. Additionally, this estimate and the February 2025 filing period includes all remaining Split Order adjustments for the September 2024 through December 2024 and Q4 2024 filing periods. Lastly, any Indiana 2024 Split Order adjustments with a date of 2/15/2025 are included, and these adjustments will be filed with your IN 2025 filing processed in 2026. Lastly, our engineering team is considering improvements to handle the differences created by the SplitOrder third-party Shopify app with Zamp's Shopify integration. We do not yet know if this is an improvement path that will be taken or when it will be released. Our engineering team is also considering different avenues of improvement that may improve this situation, without adjusting directly for the SplitOrder app. Until then, we will adjust for these split order situations each month before sending you a tax-due estimate. I hope that you're having a good week!"

Stripe sends webhook events to your server to notify you of activity in your Stripe account, such as a completed payout or a newly-created invoice. The URL of the failing webhook endpoint is: https://c69b-2401-4900-881c-a542-6dd8-4846-f7e6-9fc3.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/stripe/ You (or someone on your team) configured your Stripe account to send events to that URL. You can change your account's webhook endpoints from the Dashboard . In most cases, a failing webhook does not impact your payments or payouts. However: If you use subscriptions we rely on your webhook endpoint to notify you of new invoices. These invoices may be delayed for up to three days if your endpoint is unable to successfully receive them. If you use Checkout and rely on the checkout.session.completed event as part of your purchase fulfillment process , you should review your completed payments to ensure you have fulfilled all recent purchases. We've attempted to send event notifications to this endpoint 9 times since the first failure on March 9, 2025 at 11:58:10 AM UTC. If this endpoint is important to your application, please try and fix the issue. If you do not need this webhook endpoint, you can remove it from your Stripe webhook settings . We will stop sending event notifications to this webhook endpoint by March 18, 2025 at 11:58:10 AM UTC. Here is the summary of errors we received while attempting to send webhook events: 9 requests returned HTTP 404, indicating the URL doesn't exist. You should verify the endpoint URL is correct in your Stripe webhook settings. You need to return any status code between HTTP 200 to 299 for Stripe to consider the webhook event successfully delivered. For more details on these errors and to review your account's recent activity, you can find the full set of events and request logs on the Dashboard. For more in-depth information on how to use webhooks, we recommend reviewing our documentation . Yours, The Stripe team This email relates to your Auto Advocate Inc. Stripe account.

While working on the data, I had one quick question about invoice 10917 (under Wholesale Australia), which I previously missed: This invoice appears to have a $39 tax amount. Should this transaction be considered taxable and not wholesale/resale? Or is that a non-US tax?"

2869591074,109576,8724473658,message,2025-03-14T00:54:29Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Amy, No worries at all; thanks for sending this over! Can you confirm this is what you need? Yes, this looks like what we need. Could you please confirm if the points below are correct to ensure we understand the data correctly? The 'Talbots' invoices should be imported into Zamp as wholesale transactions with Greencastle, IN 46135 as the Ship To address. These invoices are: 10983 10984 10985 10986 10987 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. 10988 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. 10989 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. One of the ' Talbots ' invoices (10990) would be attributed to Pataskala, OH. We'll import the ' Wholesale - US ' customer group invoices (Urban Outfitters) as wholesale with the provided delivery details. The ' Wholesale Australia ' invoices would not be imported as they're delivered to locations within Australia, or other countries. The exception appears to be this invoice delivered to Florida: 10917 Based on the data we've imported into Zamp in the past, the above is likely the route to take here (outside of the 'Wholesale Australia' invoice to FL) but we wanted to confirm just in case. I was curious because I have not seen any sales tax payments being made. Just wanted to double check that's correct? As far as we know, this should be correct. Within Zamp, we can see that Standard Procedure is registered to file quarterly in California. Zamp has filed the Q2, Q3, and Q4 2024 CA returns; with Q4 2024 filed in January 2025. The payment date for the CA Q4 2024 return was 1/24/2025. I hope this helps!"

I realized today that Standard Procedure won't have any filings due this month because we file for them Quarterly in California. While we'll still want their wholesale data from Cin7 before the Q1 2025 filings start in April, it's not as pressing for this month. That said, we do want to help ensure data accuracy by requesting this data each month (if it's a quarterly month, we would need it by the 5th, but we can be more flexible in non-filing months.)

Regarding the 500 errors from yesterday: I've attached a list of affected transactions for that period. We've confirmed that all of these transactions are in Zamp. During our review of the situation, we also found that each transaction in the file I've attached was created within Zamp, likely due to retry logic implemented within your integration.

We shared the liability report and noted that improvements for the transaction filtering piece were coming.

I just wanted to follow up about the refund/void transactions causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions for this month's various filings. I'm consolidating everything to this email to simplify our work through this. A quick question : Would you like me to send out the tax-due estimates for each company regardless of the refund transaction situations below? This might help get the filings moving along and filed on time. Now that we've isolated the transactions involved, adjustments we make to the imported data would be known, and we could move forward with your approval (if you're comfortable with it) and start the filing process once the transactions have been removed from February 2025. ———————————————————— Regarding Database: The amount negative was -21.21 in Cherokee county, GA, and the transaction related to this was: re_3QmLtFBol5ufykR402xzV3E6-void (re_3QmLtFBol5ufykR402xzV3E6) - subtotal: -378.56 and tax: -22.71 ———————————————————— Regarding Leadwork: A handful of transactions caused slight negative amounts in various state and local jurisdictions. The total is roughly— $50.42 . For Washington: in_1Qi4GkAUMWrO4Kke0x1iwzyH-refund is causing a negative amount of -$1.94 in PIERCE COUNTY - AUBURN IN PIERCE COUNTY. in_1QlV5ZAUMWrO4KketsQSsWX0-refund is causing a negative amount of -$11.31 in WASHINGTON COUNTY For Tennessee: in_1QkQbQAUMWrO4Kkel8CLRuTd-refund is causing a negative amount of -$2.31 in HAMILTON COUNTY. For Louisiana: in_1QjiFrAUMWrO4KkenAcl6zSj-refund is causing a negative amount of -$3.76 in ST. LANDRY PARISH : TOWN OF ARNAUDVILLE & PARISH. For South Carolina: in_1QeoC6AUMWrO4Kkeg8gptkyI-refund is causing a negative amount of -$2.00 in AIKEN COUNTY. in_1QkYk3AUMWrO4KkeIAqnbNN5-refund is causing a negative amount of -$5.18 in ANDERSON COUNTY. Important note: The total refund tax amount here is -$6.93 . in_1QlAeAAUMWrO4KkeRj0LSsk6-refund is causing a negative amount of -$22.92 in DILLON COUNTY|UNINCORPORATED. ———————————————————— Regarding Dialect : A few transactions caused slight negative amounts in various state and local jurisdictions. The total is roughly— $22.16 . For Georgia: il_1QlzLfJIiKmDbvJMW4imS2Pu-void is causing a negative amount of -$7.14 in COBB. For Louisiana: il_1QgquLJIiKmDbvJMoj2JmgdM-void is causing a negative amount of -$14.60 in LAFAYETTE PARISH: TOWN OF YOUNGSVILLE. il_1QgquLJIiKmDbvJMbMC53u6M-void is causing a negative amount of -$0.42 in LAFAYETTE PARISH: TOWN OF YOUNGSVILLE. Please let me know if you have any questions. We aim to get the various companies' filings moving by Friday (3/14/25), but please let us know if more time might be needed and we can check if that's a possibility."

Is it ok to report the last month's transactions to Zamp so that any refunds can be reported successfully? What is the recommended way to handle this? Yes, this is 100% OK! Zamp generally recommends importing sales data back to January 1 of the previous year (in this case, 1/1/2024) for nexus analysis. If refunds are involved, it's best to do this via the API instead of a CSV to ensure the relationship can be made between refunds that can occur in the future (depending on when orders sync to Zamp.) We'd recommend backfilling (syncing) transactions from last month directly with our /transactions API endpoint. Still, we recommend keeping the request volume to 2-3 requests per minute to avoid any rate limits. There are plans to increase or scale this in the future, but those are further down the line after additional database improvements, various internal decisions, and roadmap priorities. Typically an async/await pattern with a delay will work here. Here's a basic JavaScript example I've shared to handle this kind of sync while ensuring to be under the rate limit: await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); This could be done using an existing integration if your integration supports it, or we'd recommend building a separate but related feature to handle this kind of logic (a manual sync/backfill feature can be helpful if needed). Do you think the above helps here? Can we assist with any other questions related to these refunds or the approach to take?"

I've confirmed that the NY tax-due estimate has changed to 15,687.64 and stayed at that amount; this is close to the amount you noted. Slight variances can occur here due to state-specific tax logic (e.g., rounding, time zones, etc.). We will be able to ensure timely filing as long as we can move the filings along by this Friday (3/14/25). Regarding CO: I've looked into this further and have been unable to find missing or different transactions. The Shopify US Taxes Report (which won't always align with Zamp) shows an amount of $925.25 and the Shopify Orders View here also shows similar orders/details. There's one extra order, 6959730622526/HOS4524407918 which is tied to a gift card and is treated as non-taxable within Zamp. The Zamp CO tax-due estimate also includes a timely filing discount, which is called a 'Service Fee' in CO; that amount is 16.27. I've attached an export of these transactions to help simplify our investigation here. Do you see any differences? Would you have any thoughts to share about the above?"

I've resolved the difference for New York as we now see a tax due estimate of $15,687.64. This was related to some database items; we have multiple ongoing engineering initiatives to improve this. Our filing team has checks in place to review the data before filing, but it's good to find and resolve these at other points throughout the process. I'm still investigating Colorado and hope to update you later today. Once these have been sorted out or confirmed, I'll send an updated tax due estimate your way."

Regarding the items remaining from the revisions you noted: For the transaction ID R-971545706558 shipped to California, we did not import a revision because the original transaction occurred within January 2025, and tax was paid for that order. $62 in tax was remitted to the state for the January 2025 because the original order on 1/25/2025 was included in that filing. $62 in tax is deducted from the filing for the February 2025 period because the refund was processed on 2/18/2025. Regarding R-972121866302 also shipped to CA: This transaction's revision or offset was accounted for with transaction ID 6975365513278-adjust in the CSV file I shared. We'll denote this more clearly the next time we need to make adjustments like this. Thanks for your understanding! Regarding R-970141925438 shipped to NY: This transaction's revision was accounted for with the transaction ID 6937431703614-adjust within the CSV file I shared.

Regarding the adjustments: I'm investigating this again, and I believe I left out some explanations for why I didn't offset them, but I will follow up today after I confirm. Regarding order edits: Our Shopify integration does not know when these order edits happen or the changes made because of how Shopify's Admin Order API is designed; our engineering team let us know that order edits are unsupported. Additionally, Shopify's order exports (from this page) do not show these order edits and retain the order's original amount. That said, we understand the business side of this situation, and it's a tricky balance with Shopify between being understandably customer experience focused and ensuring revenue retention. In these situations, and for now, we could help adjust if we are informed that an order edit happened, and the amount differences are shared with us by transaction ID."

2865666176,107841,8707550692,customer,2025-03-08T21:07:15Z,bijan@spoils.cc,Thanks Chris. What is the issue when an order is edited? Is it that Shopify is not pushing the new tax information associated with the revised order? I can reach out to Shopify support about this to see if it is something they can modify. It is very important for us to be able to maintain this option because in many cases we lose out on a lot of revenue when we request a customer cancel and re-enter a new order - in most cases they simply don't. ___________________ Bijan Gharavi 310.279.7090 Bijan@Spoils.cc HouseofSpoils.com

We've completed our review and the work to adjust for the differences that you've noted. Most of the transactions were voids/cancellations, and our engineering team is working to improve that (we're happy to help adjust for this). One item listed in the sheet was R-971545706558 and I left this transaction as it is because it was a refund for a January 2025 order ( HOS4524365218 ) which ended up in the February 2025 period due to the date it was refunded. This one fully refunded the tax associated with the original transaction. Please note that Order ID 6949117952062 (Shopify Order: HOS4524395718 ) was an edited order. While we understand that editing orders typically provides the best customer experience, our integration is unable to support these because Shopify's APIs do not expose all of the necessary details surrounding order edits to our integration. This means that we highly recommend against editing orders and instead creating a full refund and a separate order. We can adjust for these occasionally to help, but we won't be able to do it regularly if the volume of those kinds of edits grows. I've attached a file that was used to adjust for these differences, and we'll soon send out a tax-due estimate. Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a wonderful weekend!"

The report can be accessed here . I've also attached a version of it to this email. A couple of quick questions: For Zamp or any sales tax compliance solution, we need an address associated with an invoice to report the invoice properly within state jurisdictions. 1) Should we use the billing address for the invoices without a shipping address, or would your team need to update the shipping addresses? I'm asking because many invoices, including those with sales tax collected, do not have a shipping address. Sales tax calculations and filings are based on the shipping address for physical products. 2) Also, is it correct that your invoices without sales tax would be considered wholesale/resale or tax-exempt for another reason? These questions will help us understand your data and ensure we file your January 2025 sales tax return accurately. Once we hear back about this, we'll import the data and let our filing team know to proceed with your CO January 2025 filing."

We've completed an ongoing solution that the team I'm a part of (Technical Success) will use each month to adjust for these order edits, and we've also completed our review of all filings processed by Zamp with the comparison against Shopify's US Taxes report.

I've attached a file showing the transaction-level differences for the states where Zamp has filed since 7/1/24.

Compare that file's tax amounts to Zamp by Order ID (or order name) and find the difference. Sum the tax amount by order id. Sum the net sales amount by order ID. Create a refund transaction to offset the difference between Zamp's transactions and this Shopify report. Copy over all the transaction details and use the amounts from the Shopify report as the refund (or positive) amount. This includes the PTC and address details (those are important to continue to include.) We should do this for February to get the filing moving. Then, figure it out for historical periods where we filed. cc: @lucas - we could use your script for inspiration here and I also have some ideas."

If you're able to copy data from our sheets into templates we could happily provide our ongoing tours each month. Would that be easiest? My only concerns here are that until we scale and staff properly, we may make mistakes. The best way is to can ensure we do this properly would be to send links to all our ongoing tours monthly. Is that manageable? Each shoed would look like the attached screen shot below.

Some months we have several tours and some months there will be none! As it stands there's only 3 tours on our schedule for the year and 1 is about to wrap up on Saturday (the one in the screen shot below)

I will review the various email threads (and notes) regarding past situations, and then I can share some recommendations. One way could be to have a separate sheet (or file) containing the tour merch revenues completed for the month by the 1st to 3rd of each month. This approach should be OK, but one sure way to avoid any differences would be to use our CSV template and provide us with the data each month (after any currency conversions and validation on your end). We could also share the data with you after processing and before importing into Zamp (if preferable.) One item we'll do on our end, is ensure we only copy/export/record data for the current month using the 'Date' column and the data highlighted in the screenshot below:"
2864676934,107561,8695219227,customer,2025-03-04T21:01:15Z,crispin@goodmerchonly.com,Ok that works. There have been instances of errors being made when calculating tax owed in the past for our touring revenues so if there's any methodology we can use to create checks and balances and verify the amounts being remitted that would be ideal. As an alternative we can focus in on a system on our end to facilitate accuracy here. Let me know what you think. Crispin Day (he/him) GOOD MERCH ONLY WWW.GOODMERCHONLY.COM 416-473-4632

We understand that handling this for a full tour would be more efficient and a preferred path here. That said, Zamp would need the data monthly because the states noted below require Good Merch Only Inc. to file monthly, and we'll need the data to process filings accurately each month, keeping compliance in mind. These filing frequencies can change as each state's Department of Revenue determines them. As of right now, the monthly filing states are: AZ CO DC GA IL PA TX VA For this month, we'll pull the data for February 2025 to ensure that is included in the tax-due estimate and filings. We can continue to do this in the future as well."

Would you prefer to handle things on a monthly basis? On our end from an administrative and process standpoint it would be a bit tidier to send over the completed tour vs looping Zamp in each month on our ongoing tours?

Should we use the ""*TOUR SETTLEMENT CHAOS TOUR"" Google Sheet's ""Merch Sales"" tab for this month's filings? The majority of the February 2025 sales are in states that file only annually, except for Texas, which is filed monthly.

We'll work on importing the February 2025 sales data and once that's imported, we'll send a tax-due estimate. Regarding Nordstrom: To import the data into Zamp correctly at this time, we would need the amounts for these transactions separated by zip code or city + state. This is what we'd consider a best practice here because we need the address data to build our filings and properly ""bucket"" transactions to a specific state. To my knowledge, we do not have a specific connector for Nordstrom. Our account management and onboarding teams are investigating the options surrounding NetSuite (in case that is related to Nordstrom.) We can access NetSuite data if a user with specific permissions is provided to Zamp, although we do not currently have a connector or integration for NetSuite.

After investigating this further, I see that this situation appears to be limited to the address used. I'm escalating this to our engineering team for this address and the specific scenario to be investigated further, for a potential resolution path. Sometimes this can happen with address data. I've seen this happen in previous roles where I worked with address validation API endpoints; occasionally, the USPS cannot find/validate addresses. In my testing of a handful of other, random, addresses, I also confirmed that our address validation worked for those addresses. Have you seen this happen with any other addresses and transactions? If so, I can include those in my escalation and further investigate myself."

A null response means the address wasn't found per the API docs : Smarty does validate this address, though, so it appears tied to something with our API: Note: The ""Freeman"" portion isn't part of the address; it is likely a business (warehouse) name.

We're still exploring this within Zamp's data, it would be more doable to sort out how to build this kind of report within Shopify. We could build a custom export like this more quickly within Zamp in the future (after some upcoming, phase 2, database and infrastructure improvements are released towards the end of March.) We'll still explore both angles but Shopify will be the priority here and I'm looking into how we can do this with Shopify's new ShopifyQL reporting/analytics features.

The options are: Create a ""Fake"" transaction to bring it forward into LA's current (February) period. They can amend the return because we didn't know about it until after the filing was approved and processed. Our integration won't catch changes like these, especially if a separate refund is not created. In case the customer asks, the best process here within QBO would be: Create a complete refund transaction of the original order (likely a credit memo). If filings have already been released, e.g., it's past the ""hear back by""/approval date in the filing notice), they'll need to create it with a date in the following filing period. Recreate the invoice without tax."

Yes—we still need the Collaborator Access Code here to complete our investigation. When you say it auto expired, does it mean you are not able to access our store for tax purposes? No—our Shopify integration can still sync data from your Shopify store. The access auto-expiring is related to the separate access provided for us to log into Shopify's Admin and view your Shopify store. This is the access that we'd need to review tax settings, view orders, export orders, etc, and it's a portion of our access that allows our continued investigation. The sales tax filings will continue as they have and won't be affected by this kind of access expiring. Please let us know if you have any questions. We should be able to complete this investigation as soon as we have regained collaborator access to Shopify (via that access code, and a new access request)."

I'll have more detail to share tomorrow and can likely share a broader data set this week. The heart of the situation here will be that Zamp uses multiple time zones in our filings because our team found that adjusting for the state's time zone was the most technically compliant approach regarding sales tax filings across all states. This means that Zamp would use a PST time zone for CA, an MST time zone for CO, a CST time zone for IL, an EST time zone for OH, etc. Shopify uses a single time zone for its store, which is usually the primary location for the store. We share more information about this in our article here . Zamp extracts data from the 'baby bub' Shopify store when an order is placed. We do this via Shopify's Admin Orders API (and possibly a few other API endpoints). We receive the data in UTC and have some checks around dates/time zones. Then, Zamp adjusts for the state's specific time zone and various state-specific sales tax requirements. This means lining up data 1:1 between Zamp (and many sales tax compliance solutions) will be tricky. However, this will be simpler if we focus on a single state, California. We're happy to help explain the various pieces and share the data. We appreciate your patience and understanding! A couple of quick questions: What time zone is your Shopify store based in? This will help me understand the potential differences. Also, when you have a moment, could you please share your Shopify store's collaborator access code ? It appears Zamp's access auto-expired as that can happen every 90-days."

Noticed that there are a few transactions of 1st Dec included in Nov and some transactions of 1st Nov are not included. I am sure that you are making adjustments in Oct month calculation by including the 1st Nov transactions and in Dec month by excluding the ones considered in Nov. But how do you keep a track and more importantly, how are we going to double check? Coz if we extract data from 1st Nov to 30th Nov, we will not be able to trace the exact value of Sales tax until we get a calculation from your side. In short, just want to understand how you extract data for a month? So that I follow the same steps to double check. Here are the snapshot from excel working: 1) Highlighted are the Dec transactions 2) 1st Nov transactions. Only 12 in excel but there are 18 in total:"

I've attached an export of your California November 2024 transactions, which were used to calculate the California prepayment amount for that same month. A few items to note about this file: The tax used in our calculations is listed in column J ( transactionTax .) This is an export that I modified as a one-time exception to be what we call ""transaction-level,"" which means that it does not have the usual line items shown in our exports. This was done to simplify summing the tax and other amounts, but we can share a line item file if you'd like. (Note: line item files have order IDs and transaction-level (tax, subtotal, discounts, etc.) repeated; summing them in Excel can be tricky.) The Transaction IDs shown in the file are in column B ( transactionId ), and we have access to this ID via Shopify's API. Within Shopify, this ID is available in an order's URL, and you can still search for orders via these IDs in Shopify Admin. In a Shopify order export, this ID is included in column BD (titled Id .) The date listed in column L ( transactionDate ) is a UTC date and our filings convert these dates into the state's specific time zone; we share more details in this article . I hope this is helpful to you. Please let us know if you have any questions! We're happy to schedule a call if needed as well. Have a wonderful weekend!"

This is interesting, and I've been reviewing various logs involved in the calculation process. I haven't found a calculation for this address where the tax-due amount was more than $66.85. A few questions: 1) What was the Order ID associated with this in BigCommerce? 2) On your end (anywhere), do you see an indication of when the quote was provided on 2/18/25? I've looked at logs for 2/17, 2/18, 2/19, and 2/24, and I don't see tax calculations coming to Zamp with more than 66.85 tax due returned. 3) To ensure we're on the same page, was this screenshot from an order within BigCommerce? I'm asking because this looks like a fallback tax rate of 10% is being applied, but that should only happen if the Zamp API is unreachable or there's some error in the address/other part of the order."

After reviewing the stores involved again, the Shopify sales data syncs on our end, and we have confirmed with our engineering team the causes of the missing Shopify data. Those causes are: The transactions were missing for the Chuckle Sandwich store because the initial bulk sync for historical data from Shopify only included 1/1/2024-1/28/2024; it was a typo when initiating the sync; we'll catch these better in the future. For the Flashgitz, the missing transaction (#FLG8425) failed to sync to Zamp because of an invalid address. During our transaction sync process with any Shopify store, we attempt to confirm that the address exists. If it does not, we cannot import the transaction (this happens very rarely). The above also means that this is not a systemic issue and should be a one-time situation. Lastly, I've also audited all of the historical imports for the stores noted below (these have been connected since 12/1/2024) to ensure this kind of date-related typo scenario hasn't happened with other stores, and we're all set, in the clear, with these.

We're happy to help with the Shopify exports, but we would need to rework the Zamp collaborator access to include the order export for all stores. I've also reviewed the last six months of sales data sync processes from Shopify to Zamp and confirmed that the transactions (I have access to a record of) that failed to sync were international (non-US) transactions. Once we hear back from our engineering team and complete a review of February through March exports, we can confirm if the previous and future data is in a good spot. I will likely hear more from our engineering team this week."

When you're ready, could we do the same for March? We used the January export Heather (or someone else) shared to compare January.

I don't want this to become a monthly exercise that tech success is burdened with at such low variances. Let's figure out if we want to do it preemptively or wait and see if they do it again and then address it.

After investigating this further, the amounts shown for the payments to the various state DORs are correct and match the sales data within Zamp for Oats Overnight. This applies to each state noted in the screenshot: AR, SD, RI, GA, and TN. The reasons for these differences vary: For Georgia, the difference was a $4.32 vendor's compensation credit/discount from the state of GA for timely filing. RI matched the initial notice. The difference was primarily caused by Shopify Transactions imported after the tax-due estimate was sent for AR, SD, and TN. These transactions occurred within January 2025 but were imported on 2/4/25 or after. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

SD - notice: $2,497.94 - payment - $2,556.34, matches return and report . The discount is listed on the report but not taken, likely due to when it was filed or if the discount doesn't apply. RI - notice: $147.80 - payment - $147.80, matches - didn't look at return/report. GA - notice: $144.00 - payment - $139.68, matches the return and report . The difference is due to a $4.32 vendor's compensation (timely filing discount.) TN - notice: $14,229 - payment - $14,306, matches the return and report . So far, while I'm unsure of the cause of these differences, it is okay and normal. GA, at least, was due to a timely filing discount. Looking at the attached exports, we can see with the zampcreateddate and the zampupdateddate , that there were quite a few transactions imported between when the notice was sent (2/3) and when the filings happened. This appears to be the main cause."

I reviewed this month's Colorado, Tennessee, Washington, and Utah filings to see if we could move any of the December 2024 transactions forward into the January 2025 filing period. I found that we're currently unable to move the majority of the transactions except for transaction ID in_1PcGU0AUMWrO4KkeZKfUhxFS-refund (the tax amount was—$10.20) because the local jurisdictions affected either don't have enough tax due or do not have enough to account for the full refunded tax amounts. Would you like us to move this single transaction?"

I'm also creating a Google Sheet to track this month-to-month and can share this with you once it's ready. A quick question: Can we get a list of all the transactions (as you've provided in the SQL5 files like the one attached) for the 7/1/24-10/31/24 and 12/1/24-12/2/24 transactions? I could not accomplish what I hoped with the shipping address (line 1) and the zip code you provided on 1/12/24. Please let me know if this is a bunch of extra work or not possible. If that is the case, I'll explore alternatives (such as a much more involved script for API calls on our end), or we will need to wait until various database scaling improvements are released sometime in Q1/Q2 2025. My goal with gathering this data by state is to ensure we're correctly offsetting the duplicate taxes by stat,e and my previous ideas (to save you all time) haven't worked as hoped. :)"

We worked with Ryan and updated a few items that helped us solve this situation. To avoid this confusion in the future, we'll work on updated documentation and improved scripting on our side. I've imported your January 2025 data, and you should receive an updated tax-due estimate within 1-2 hours. I've attached some files to show the data we exported from QBO to accomplish this and the file we imported into Zamp. Here they are: The first file, "" file.xlsx ,"" is a combination of QBO exports; we used this as the source data. The second file, "" TechTradeSolutions - QBO Export - 01JAN2025-31JAN2025.csv ,"" is the file we're importing into Zamp to rebuild the tax-due estimate. After reviewing the data, all missing invoices were present except for the TX invoice ( 30099 ) because, within QBO, it's dated 2/5/2025. This means we'll import that invoice next month for the February 2025 TX filing due then. As soon as we send you the tax-due estimate, we'll need to hear back from you about approval to proceed quickly today or tomorrow to ensure we can complete the various state sales tax returns by the due dates. Florida has a tricky set of due dates and payment expectations, so we hope to move sooner than others."

Unfortunately, on the Zamp side, we haven't run into this error recently. Any memories of resolving similar errors are from a while ago (at different roles/companies); only vaguely remembered. Currently, Zamp does not have an integration with Google Merchant Center. That said, it does appear that it could be worth double-checking the following items within the Google Merchant Center: Please ensure the prices within Google Merchant Center are not tax-inclusive, meaning tax is excluded. Confirm or update the tax settings within Google Merchant Center to match your BigCommerce store's. This will ensure that both stores enable taxes for the same states. In this article , Google shares how to access the tax settings and some basic steps. Confirm whether the product or tax categories match those of Google Merchant Center and BigCommerce. Here are the states that we'd want to ensure are enabled within Google Merchant Center: We're also happy to hop on a call to review this with you, and a call can be scheduled with this link: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min ."

She'll work with the client and their processes to decide how to handle this address change/tax issue from an accounting perspective. Get a transaction export to them for all 2024 transactions; it must be run in Metabase. Talia needs this because our data is more accurate than Shopify's and they're trying to do a year-end close. In the future, they'll reconcile monthly, making it more smooth. We'll likely want to do this in chunks as it's ~300k transactions, and Excel will probably crash.

Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do other than escalate it to the builders to see if they have any ideas, but I doubt that will go anywhere, although it would be great to solve this. This is ultimately something they'd need to bring up with Shopify. One possible resolution is to cancel the original order before payment or process a full refund. Then, a new order with the corrected address could be placed. However, this isn't a good or efficient process, and they likely wouldn't like the customer experience involved. Others are aware of this, as far as I know. Matt Grattan brought this issue up with one of his Shopify Product contacts during the various calls/emails about MUDWtr issues."

IE: This order would not be filed to NV, but would be filed to OR if it was a state that we filed with. In theory, There is a lot of problems with this. I am aware that this on the OPS team for Look Optic. There s a lot of orders that the shipping address ends up different, as each state I pull up shows taxes for different states.

Regarding order number 475047LK, we recommend reaching out to Shopify to discuss this further because our understanding is that Shopify doesn't update the tax calculations after an address is changed on an order in this order's specific case.

This tax was not remitted to the state of Nevada as the transaction came to us with a ship-to address of Oregon. I hope this helps to clarify, Ashley"

I believe that I answered this through another email thread with Becky, and I've shared that answer below. Please let me know if you have any questions! I'm jumping in to help answer the outstanding API question. So that you know, any API (or technical) questions can also be directed to support@zamp.com ; those questions can also be routed to the team I'm a part of. 🙂 How would a refund transaction affect reporting for the following month? Would it just be netted against the transactions of that month? For example, if a Jan 26th transaction is refunded on Feb 6th, that negative amount on Feb 6th would be used to offset the transactions in Feb. Yes, if a refund transaction is created within Zamp on February 6th, 2025, it will be netted against the transactions for February 2025. The other option is not to create the transaction within Zamp. Instead, someone on the Wayo team would file an amended return with the state associated with the transaction to recover the refunded sales tax."

How about creating a refund transaction, can it be made after the 3rd of the following month?

2840808385,99788,8631200109,message,2025-02-12T18:29:20Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Taylor, I'm following up with a quick update here! We reviewed the differences you noted between Washington and Nevada and found they are expected. I'll share more details below. Overall, the cause of the difference relates to state-specific sales tax logic built into our tax-due estimates (and, by extension, our filings) that are not accounted for when looking at a raw tax collected amount within BigCommerce, Shopify, Volusion, or other systems. Regarding WA: You noted that $1,376.30 was collected in tax, and the tax-due estimate from Zamp was $1,492.27 . The difference here is $115.97 . While reviewing the filing details associated with the WA January 2025 return, we found that most of this difference is due to the WA B&O tax. This gross receipts tax is not collected from customers and is due when filing sales tax returns. This amount was $147.39 . Please note that state-specific rounding and time zone differences ( noted in this article , which mentions Shopify, but these scenarios can apply to other platforms/carts/systems as well) are likely responsible for the overall difference. Depending on the number of transactions and the state, these two items can cause variances of a few dollars up to hundreds of dollars. Regarding NV: You noted that $617.61 was collected in tax, and the tax-due estimate from Zamp was $660.10 . The difference here is $42.49 . We reviewed all of the Nevada transactions from multiple angles, looking for any potential missing transactions or situations that might cause differences; we could not find anything that raised concerns. The difference for NV is also likely related to rounding or a time zone difference between the transactions you're viewing in your reports and the time zone Zamp uses. In NV, Zamp's estimates and filings adjust for transactions that fall within the Pacific Time Zone (PST), which can cause transactions to occur at the beginning or end of a filing period (the first or last day). I've also attached an export containing all transactions synced with Zamp shipped to customers in Nevada; the amount is close to your initial amount. We also share some details about our filing notices and tax-due estimates that may be helpful in this article . Do we have your approval to proceed with the Dorm Company Corporation's filings for January 2025?"
2840808385,99788,8631012912,note,2025-02-12T17:35:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"WA - The difference is $115.97; Zamp has a higher amount. The difference is likely just B&O tax plus rounding. The customer's noted difference is $115.97, and B&O is 147.39, which is $31.42 greater than the difference here, and that small of an amount is likely rounding. NV - the difference is $42.49; Zamp has a higher amount. After exporting NV transactions, we get an amount of about $621. The differences here are likely related to rounding and time zone."

2839446992,99080,8720452681,message,2025-03-12T22:50:17Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Kayley, Jackie, and Team, Thanks again for your patience! We looked into this from multiple angles and found that the primary cause of differences in the January 2025 filing processed in February was related to two items, which I'll note below. The first item concerns a limitation of Shopify's reporting, and the second concerns the Loop Discount being disabled within Loop, as AvaTax requires (which is the opposite of what Zamp needs). The Shopify Sales tax by Region Report does not appear to include POS or in-person store sales. This accounted for $47,110.05 of the difference. The Loop Exchange orders were duplicating tax on a small subset of orders, ~80 orders in January and another ~80 in February. This accounted for $3,737.42 of the difference. The above means that $3,737.42 in tax was overpaid out of the initial estimate of $50,001.50 . The good news is that we're adjusting for that this month for any monthly filings and in future filings for any non-monthly filings. Here's a breakdown based on the original figures shared from Zamp and by Jackie in February: Regarding the Shopify Sales tax by Region Report : When we exported transactions from Shopify, we found that there weren't orders missing within Zamp when comparing a Zamp export to the Shopify export. Here's what we did in this Report to sort this out: When we sorted the 'Is POS sale' column descending so that 'Yes' was at the top, we found that there were only two indications of this at the top for FL and CA. Here's what this looked like: We also found that the number of rows with 'Is POS sale' did not increase or change when we grouped by the Order ID: In the above screenshot, it appears to account for only two orders. The query powering the Shopify Report likely needs some additional tweaking or filtering. This report is a newer release from Shopify using their ShopifyQL option, and we're still learning more about it. This could be related to the lack of a billing or destination address for POS orders, or some specific quirk to how Shopify built/queries this report. We could help you determine the best way to deal with that report and improve the data it returns, but Shopify Plus Support can likely help more efficiently. Please let us know if you'd like to schedule a call with Ashley and me. Regarding Loop Exchange orders duplicating tax: As we discussed on our call, this is a situation in which Zamp needs the opposite of an AvaTax setting requirement. We will raise this issue as a feature request to our engineering team and ask them to explore accounting for it in future improvements. For now and in the future, we will adjust for this manually by creating 'refund offset' transactions to remove the duplicate tax, and we'll eventually have a way to exclude these transactions altogether. I've imported adjustment files to offset the duplicate tax from Loop Exchange orders into your Zamp account for both of the months below: January 2025 - recovering $3,737.42 in sales tax. February 2025 - ensuring $3,165.80 in sales tax is not duplicated. Once the adjustments are processed, we will send you a tax-due estimate either tonight or tomorrow (3/13). Please let me know if you have any questions. If it's better to talk through this, I'm happy to hop on a call ."

Importing the loop exc offset files too. Here's how we think the Shopify report isn't including POS transactions: Sorted with 'YES' Is POS Sale at the top, only two exist."

2839446992,99080,8719609460,note,2025-03-12T18:02:05Z,chris@zamp.com,"What we need to do here for filings this month: Find all Loop transactions with 'EXC' in the externalName column and create offset/refund transactions to remove the tax for those orders. These transactions duplicate the tax, inflating the tax amount paid. Sum the tax associated with all POS location (in-store location) transactions from the Shopify export for January and February. Do that by state to share with the customer. Compare against the sales tax by region Shopify report—the suspicion is that this report doesn't include POS/location sales. This is likely a limitation of Shopify's reporting. Going forward and after this week: Investigate the differences between the Zamp variance review and Shopify exports, and figure out why. We want to figure this out for January and previous periods to see if there's a larger issue."

I split up the exports to speed them up and ensure that we didn't need to request all data from all states and sources for December since that only affects NY. The exports are: A file containing NY Web/online store transactions for December 2024. A file containing NY POS - in-person store transactions for December 2024. All transactions for February 2025 - including international. For the full-month, all transaction exports: February 2025 - all sales data (filtering only by date) applies to the January 2025 export above . We'll need to filter out transactions shipped to a non-US country for this export. There might still be differences between files; some rows in the Shopify export don't have the ship to address as they're line items (we need to sort out a good way to filter those). Maybe the strategy before processing/data review: Filter the file for non-US Shipping locations. Before deleting those rows, copy the order name or ID. Store those IDs in another sheet. Delete the non-US shipping rows. Use VLOOKUP or similar to find rows that match the stored IDs. Delete the rows matching the IDs. Happy to help with this as well!"

Loop discount is enabled, but they use AvaTax, and that's needed there. (Adjustments or switch to Shopify tax until Eng can account for the loop discount if it's disabled, although that's not a guarantee.) Time zone differences, which includes refunds. ————————————————————————————————————————- Notes from the call with Jackie, Kayley (Shopify/Ecomm team), Tasia (analyst/ecomm team, and Carina (Cult Gaia CS) -45 minutes. Jackie said she's probably OK with adjustments and they want the refund for the extra tax paid. She wants to know the amount for the past overpayments and needs to share this with her CFO. They're not going to switch from or go off of AvaTax, they just upgraded and signed another contract (from the sound of it.) They'll let their CFO know. They use AvaTax with other countries as well. Shopify apps: They use NetSuite, which goes from Shopify to NetSuite via Celigo. Loop should be the only other one. NetSuite/Celigo —> Shopify: They don't have a flow to edit orders from NetSuite to Shopify. If they need to edit something, usually a tax-only refund (for taxable —> nontaxable changes in NJ since AvaTax is getting this wrong right now) and there are examples below. Examples of tax-only refunds: #344692 #344691 #344545 #344541 #341789 #341548 #339689 #338362 #336279 #334141"

2836791595,98186,8885154863,message,2025-04-30T18:25:57Z,ryan@zamp.com,"Hi Mike & Eric, Chris is currently out of the office, so I'm stepping in to assist. Do you happen to log your requests to our /calculations endpoint, or associate them with the transactions on your side? If so, do you have a .txt export by chance? It would be great to see the request bodies on calculations and compare to the transaction data. For an explanation on timezone handling, here are a few key highlights: We ingest transactions and save them via UTC. So for example, if you pass to us a transaction  that you've localized the 'transactionDate' for as '2025-04-01T06:00:00.000Z', we will treat that as 6:00am UTC, which is technically 2025-03-31 as a reported transaction date. We now allow viewing transactions by a specific timezone in our Transactions interface when logged into Zamp, so you could view it in PST if you chose to. We file and localize transactions based on the state's timezone . When it comes down to states that span multiple timezones, we get even more specific and go by the timezone of the state's capitol . Timezones and compliance (in any industry) are always a bit of a monster, but we try to simplify it by always suggesting giving us the transactions in UTC, and offsetting to whatever standard you follow. For example, perhaps you treat all transactions (regardless of where they occur) as a realized sale based on PST. Hope this all makes some sense, timezones can be tricky!"

The transaction date they send to us and the transaction date we use for filing. Since the client is using our API, should we see variations due to time zones? We need the transaction data they are using to create the report, to find the cause of the difference, as Chris asked."

We can relieve some of this confusion if we could see the transaction date for tax purposes on the export file from your website. I would also appreciate a more technical explanation of why and when these two dates don't always coincide, and if there is anything we can do on our end to help reduce this dependency. ~Eric Atchison Lead Software Design Basics Etc Corp (714) 697-6573"
2836791595,98186,8862650713,note,2025-04-25T01:43:39Z,chris@zamp.com,"@nick @ryan @lucas - when you have some time, could any of you help look into this? The issue: The customer was expecting to see a tax payment of $40,575 for the remaining tax due for the Q1 2025 CA period (after January and February prepayments). The report they shared above (starting with 'RPT_Mike...') shows 40,720.24. They're based in CA, so it's unlikely that the cause is a time zone difference, but it could be (if they run their report in UTC vs. Zamp filing in PST, or some other edge-case difference). This is also an API customer, so we'd expect what they collect to match Zamp's calculations. So, this is a bit different from a Zamp vs Shopify reconciliation. For Zamp API customers, we set transactionRecalculate to true by default when creating transactions in Zamp; we always file based on taxDue not taxCollected (which is the opposite of what we do for Shopify/other non-API integrations.) What I've found so far: We see very little under-collection in the CA report ($0.22): https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/state-reports/CA/2025-Q1 These are all of the Q1 2025 CA transactions, $133k: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/transactions?date=2025-01-01~2025-03-31&shipToState=CA We see $42,455.63 for March 2025: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/transactions?date=2025-03-01%7E2025-03-31&shipToState=CA This is still higher than the initial estimate. Looking at all their transactions for Q1 2025 in CA, I don't see any transactions that likely caused this difference overall (in Q1 or March 2025) because they were primarily created or updated within the same period. Query: https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/6436-transaction-export-by-a-state-list-with-reportedon-and-zampcreated?company=clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas&start=2025-01-01&end=2025-03-31 This export is attached. I don't see any concerns or significant variation between taxDue and taxCollected when exporting the variance review query here ; an export is attached. We may look at March 2025 for CA on its own, but I don't see causes for concern here. Overall, my theory is that there is a difference in reporting between their system and Zamp but I can't quite prove it yet."

On the Zamp side, we aren't seeing an indication of under-collection in sales tax, so the difference is likely related to the date and time values used for the transactions, or something else entirely. That said, we want to help sort this out and ensure we're all on the same page moving forward. When you have a moment, could you share the records or an export of the transaction data used to build the XLSX tax jurisdiction report you shared? This way, we can compare directly and confirm the causes based on expected behavior. We can also share an export of the data within Zamp if it would be helpful; our goal here is to sort out the differences in a way that saves you all time."

Column G is the transaction subtotal Column H is the transaction S&H - always $0 Column I is the transaction Tax - always $0 as these are Wholesale Sales to a retailer Column J is the transaction total amount Column K is the shipping address.

We looked into this further and found that the refund (#GILS1477) from the Gils Arena store was imported into Zamp; I've attached an export from Zamp showing this. This export can also be requested by logging into your Zamp portal and navigating to the Transactions page here with state and date range filters. Here's how to request an export: Just so you know, this screenshot was taken within a test account, and you will see something different within your Zamp account. Here's what I see within the Underdog Sports Holdings Zamp account: Here's what is happening with this refund: Within Zamp, a refund Transaction is not accounted for within the tax-due estimate if it will cause a local Jurisdiction to become negative (e.g., '-3.91' in this transaction's situation). The above means that this refund transaction (#GILS1477) caused the local jurisdiction of HAMPTON CITY to be negative, as there were $0 in sales to that jurisdiction. Most states do not allow sales tax returns to be filed with negative amounts. Please note that the Virginia Department of Taxation can issue a refund or credit. Their PDF documentation outlines how to submit such a request . Next steps: Do we have your approval to proceed with your sales tax filings for the January 2025 filing period this month? If Zamp is to file for Underdog Sports Holdings this month, we must hear back about this approval by Friday (2/14/25)."

I tried to do as much research on it as I could. The customer says that a refund is missing from their VA filing, but the refund does appear in our system and the report is zeroed out for associated jurisdiction. My guess is that they might be expecting the total $3.14 due in VA to be offset by refund #GILS1477 (-$3.91). The sales posted to VA this month are in other counties than where the refund is posted. I remember hearing that refunds are magic mathed to zero out, but I'm not familiar enough with how our system handles them. VA filing https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clz38bhkz012tkqe6ykleqfv5/state-reports/VA/2025-JAN Issue Per customer: VA is missing Refund #GILS1477 Research #GILS1477 is included in the period https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clz38bhkz012tkqe6ykleqfv5/transactions?from=2025-01-01&to=2025-02-04&shipToState=VA Took a look at Metabase : Jurisdiction is HAMPTON CITY for the tranx Note - my access in metabase for this table is view only Compared to our VA report Jan 2025 Hampton City is zeroed out across all fields. Two other orders posted to this period were in FAIRFAX COUNTY & FAUQUIER COUNTY Original order Does not appear in the Jan 2025 period I think it's #GILS1477 that was reported with the Dec 2024 return Tranx list for Dec 2024 & Jan 2025 https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clz38bhkz012tkqe6ykleqfv5/transactions?from=2024-12-01&to=2025-01-31&shipToState=VA"

We then imported the data manually via CSV after requesting an export from QBO using this Zamp Sales Tax custom Report. Zamp's tax-due estimate amounts for Texas, Illinois, Alabama, and Indiana are now in line with your expectations. The differences here appear to be related to state-specific sales tax rounding, time zone differences between how Zamp files returns and QBO reports tax amounts, and state-specific timely filing discounts (which are included in most of our estimates.) Illinois's estimate is not $5,875.00. Texas' estimate is now $10,345.16. Alabama's estimate is not precisely $2,156.42. Please let us know if you have any questions. We'll need to get these filings started today to have them filed by or before the state's various sales tax filing and payment due dates."

We found that some invoices from QBO were missing, which is partly related to the automatic QBO integration. In the interest of moving filings along in time for the various state's sales tax return due dates, we are switching to importing the data via a CSV file after exporting from QBO because the tax-due estimates should be closer to expectations. I hope to have your updated estimate tonight after our Engineering Team removes the automatically imported QBO invoice data."

They essentially use cash accounting, partly because sometimes payments fail for subscriptions in Stripe, and their CS team has a process to retry, reach out, etc, eventually it becomes 'uncollectible.' After explaining the human error when investigating the CSV/Zamp Stripe integration differences, River noted a large gross sales/revenue difference but a minimal tax difference. Due to the above, he was comfortable proceeding with the Stripe integration. The understanding here is that the voided or uncollectible transactions will eventually even out across multiple filing periods. We should expect about 3750+ transactions from Stripe altogether. This was a file showing the differences from January: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gf1C5wQqn5lc7osL6_2DDMRZ0cxeSsz9ptyC0CsJjt8/edit?gid=235900895#gid=235900895"

Would you have time next week to discuss the differences, the logic of our Stripe integration, and the path forward? We can use this link to schedule a call: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min . We found that the original total difference was incorrect due to a slight human/formula error. Additionally, I've confirmed that our Stripe integration is currently designed to import all invoices from Stripe regardless of the payment status; this aligns with Zamp's design to follow accrual-based accounting practices (instead of cash-based.)

The results below are from using the total column sum by clicking on the header. Google sheet total (515,437.20) - Zamp total (515,272.81) = 164.39 (This is not accounting for discount in subtotal) Google Sheet tax   (43,195.79)    - Zamp tax.   (43,171.05) = 24.74 ( Zamp tax is different now since we are not using the stripe intergration now) In regards to the different amount of transactions with the automation, Zamp is importing 502 additional transactions. Most of them are a transaction and then supplemental voided transactions. There are 59 unaccounted-for transactions that I suspect are listed as a "" Failed or Not-paid"" status . River was filtering those out before posting them to the Google Sheet. I feel a call with the customer is needed to further understand any other filtering done and to see if they can set up their Stripe integration to Accrual instead of Cash based. CC @chris"

There might have been a way to exclude them from going through but it wasn't shared with us and I only noticed it last week. The site should be going live any day now so future transactions as of next week are all valid. cheers Kristen Kirsten Barrie Founder/Owner Verte Consulting High-touch CFO & Accounting Services For Your Agency, Startup, or Scale-up"

2825435184,94299,8632542945,message,2025-02-13T02:04:19Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Kirsten and Katie, Thanks for your patience here. We have requested that these transactions be removed, and our engineering team will take care of them. We'll follow up immediately as soon as we hear that this has been completed. Because of how our Shopify integration is designed, there's a slight chance these transactions could be re-imported if they are changed in the future. That said, we are working towards solutions to prevent this in the future. Due to the above, we will also review the Final Switchback LLC Zamp account to ensure the test transactions are not present before the WA Q1 2025 filing is processed in April 2025. Please let us know if you have any questions. I hope that everyone has a great evening!"

Please feel free to call me. We are aware of the transactions currently in Shopify are test transactions and I have looped in our Technical Success team to ensure that these are not included in your Q1 2025 filing due in April. Look forward to talking with you soon, Ashley"

CCing clete@zamp.com and msprague@zamp.com as a headsup that this onboarding is still going poorly and sharing this feedback for improvement, and hopefully a nudge to get some help here? thanks Kirsten Kirsten Barrie Founder/Owner Verte Consulting High-touch CFO & Accounting Services For Your Agency, Startup, or Scale-up"

Let me verify this - katiereim16@gmail.com can you quickly confirm those aren't actual sales but rather test transactions? I'm unsure how sales can occur when the site isn't online or public but maybe I'm missing something? I/we will get on a call as soon as we can coordinate it - much appreciated.
