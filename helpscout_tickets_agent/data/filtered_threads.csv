There is no setting that should prevent transactions for customers based in New Jersey from syncing with Zamp, while transactions from other states sync fine. This situation may be related to something on the Keylight side or something specific to these invoice transactions. That said, we'll review the logs and look for anything that might help us determine what is happening here. We should have an update for you by tomorrow (7/23)."

After reviewing further, I found that the significant difference in Total Sales for the Texas Q2 2025 period (4/1/25-6/30/25) was due to the recalculation of sales tax for the bookmarks that was previously done. After redoing and correcting the recalculation work, we now have the total sales numbers for TX: Total Texas Sales: $5,711.00 This includes $196.00 (rounded up from $195.65) in sales in TX through Amazon. This includes $5,515.00 (rounded down from 5,515.19) in sales in TX through Shopify. This is made up of the $5,483.79 Net Item Sales amount and the $31.40 Total Shipping amount. Taxable Sales: $5,515.00 Resolving this difference also changed the estimated tax due to $452.72 , which includes $282.35 of tax that was collected and $170.37 in tax that was not collected; Zamp recalculated accordingly. I've triple-checked the amounts and work here; these are accurate. Do we have your approval to proceed with the TX Q2 2025 filing now that the amounts align with Shopify?"

I appreciate the detail but after reviewing I'm a bit confused regarding the sales tax due and total Texas sales calculations. I reviewed our Shopify total sales report for Q2, which shows total sales of $8,564.69. With Texas sales listed below in the screenshot, could you please clarify which report you are using that shows Shopify's total taxable Texas sales as $9,098.00? I understand there was a recalculation of sales tax for the bookmarks, but I'd like some clarity on the sales numbers provided.

The figures for the Q2 filing shouldn't change because those amounts are the tax-due estimate (that email doesn't include gross sales).

Currently, all of our sales are direct-to-consumer via Stripe (which, of course, integrates seamlessly with you). For a particular B2B deal, we'll be selling 150 devices and memberships in bulk to a Californian university, who will then distribute them to staff and students. We're currently at 60% of the $500k CA threshold, and this transaction would take us up to 80%, so no issues around tax collection, we're more looking for guidance on how best to handle the threshold tracking in this case. A couple of options we were considering: Manually import the transaction into Zamp via CSV, alongside our regular Stripe-collected transactions. Preferred. We can raise an invoice outside of Stripe. Raise a manual invoice in Stripe and have Zamp handle tax collection as you do with our usual B2C sales. Slightly cautious with this, as reporting may be impacted (and also individual tax thresholds - see below) due to the way our Stripe is currently set up. In addition, we plan to activate the memberships via 100% discount in Stripe for each of the 150 users, but unsure if this may create tax threshold implications on a per-user basis - could you comment on this? Be good to get your input. Thanks in advance! Andrew Long Financial Controller"

I've ensured the transactions Bobbi found were adjusted correctly, and from now on (until there are more programmatic ways to deal with Order Edits), we'll keep partially_refunded Shopify order statuses as a part of the usual month-to-month process. I'll be more careful in the future. What happened here is that I did not adjust for these paritally_refunded transactions after reviewing what I thought were transactions adjusting properly, and that caused the issue Bobbi noticed. I've also reviewed transactions back to March 2025 at Bobbi's request and confirmed that the partially_refunded transactions from 3/1/25-6/30/25 are all accounted for. I've attached the updated supporting documentation for this process. A new tax-due estimate will be sent out in the next few minutes.

NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED -- please hold off on approvals/processing.

New issue:
When we do an EDIT ORDER (eg a size change from XS to S), we know already that we need to manually minus out the 'duplicate' item - since only 1 item was shipped.
However, it seems if the shipped item ends up getting returned for refund anyway, Zamp is NOT recording the tax adjustment for that returned item.

Example order: Only 1 item ordered -- price $195. Only 1 item paid. Size changed from XS to S/4 (via Edit Order). See 3 line items in Zamp calculation below: Because of the edit order, Zamp currently thinks 2 items were sold, for a total of $390 with $34.14 in tax. There seems to be a manual deduction (I think by Chris) that deducts the 1 duplicate item, resulting in -$16.27 in tax. However, after the item actually shipped (S/4 size in this example), and the customer decides to return for refund, we should get a negative tax adjustment of lets say $16.27 or $17-- but that's missing now. Chris -- please have a look at this example, and we can discuss today before 5:30pm EST if you have time.

We are out of the office on Thursday and Friday, so would need to review today.

And then once we find the logic issue here, let's pls go back and search for and adjust for all similar cases (Edit Order + Refund afterwards).

Thanks,
Jason"

First, we're happy to share that our engineering team has released some significant improvements since mid-June that now properly account for these transaction scenarios with Shopify transactions: Voided/Expired transactions - we now create a separate refund transaction to account for these. I validated this by reviewing voided orders within a Shopify export and comparing them to Zamp. Partial refunds that are not order edits are captured, and I validated this by reviewing 'partially_refunded' orders within a Shopify export and comparing them against Zamp. The above means that I made adjustments to Shopify Transactions within Zamp by reviewing 'partially_paid' and 'paid' transactions from a 'web' source with a positive outstanding balance. Please note that the process we previously agreed upon remains unchanged, except for the updates mentioned above regarding voided/expired/partial refund adjustments. We also have additional work scheduled to start in August 2025 to reattempt finding a solution for order edits within Shopify. Meaning—there's a chance these adjustments won't be necessary in the future, but we don't yet have an exact timeline. I've also adjusted for the remaining prior period refunds in California and Colorado. I've attached three files: A file showing the Shopify adjustment transaction work. An export of the Zamp Transactions for states with filings this month. This includes a Pivot table showing tax amounts by state. The tax-due estimate I sent previously is also included in this file. The prior period refunds brought into June 2025 for the previous periods. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Although I don't currently have a transaction-by-transaction tax rate file to share, I've identified the cause of the difference in tax due expectations here. Regarding Pennsylvania: We found that for PA, just the state rate (6%) was collected on some of the transactions, which did not include any locals (there are two in PA), and this ties into some details that Matt Grattan shared on 7/10/25 around ensuring not to overcharge customers when rates change throughout the state, and over time. Once we recalculated the PA Transactions to match Zamp's expectations, the tax-due estimate was updated to a number closer to your expectation. The estimated tax-due amount is now: $4,291.38 . This includes a timely filing discount of $43.35. Regarding Texas: Texas is a bit of a tricky situation, which we share more details about here , with Business-to-Business Software as a Service (B2B SaaS) because our understanding and Zamp's calculation engine considers the below information, which differs from a flat 8.25% rate across the board: Texas considers SaaS a data processing service, which subjects it to an 80% sales tax on the service's price. This also means that 20% of the price of a SaaS service in Texas is considered tax-exempt. The above leads to the following amounts and breakdown, which align with the tax-due estimate for TX: A taxable sales amount of $7,810 - these are sales to non-exempt entities. The original non-exempt total sales amount (excluding non-profit sales) was $9,762.78 , which the taxable amount noted above represents as 80% of. A tax-due estimate of $644.33 , less a timely filing discount of $3.22 , for a total estimated tax due of $641.11 . The above means that the $ 641.11 tax-due amount is our estimate of the correct amount, considering the taxability of SaaS in Texas. A question and next steps: Do we have your approval to move forward with filings for both Texas and Pennsylvania? These two states have due dates of the 20th this month, and we want to ensure timely filing. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I believe we have everything sorted out for the current filings due this month in California and Washington. We'll work on documenting this process internally to ensure this is accounted for accurately and smoothly from now on. A few items to note: 1) We cleared out all of the transactions in Zamp and recreated the transactions utilizing the reports Renee shared, and the custom Zamp invoice list report. 2) We imported California Transactions and did not import any Washington Transactions because the sales tax liability for WA showed a negative balance (see the attached file.) This is something we can help address in future WA sales tax filings, to recover overpaid tax. 3) I sent an updated tax-due estimate to Chuck and Renee. When accounting for sales tax rounding (which CA requires, at the jurisdiction-level), the estimate is within $3.36. A few questions: 1) Urgent —do we have your approval to proceed with the sales tax filings in WA and CA for Q2 2025? Our filing team can file these on time, but the faster we can proceed with approval, the better. 2) Regarding invoices in non-nexus states or states where tax is not yet collected, and this might be a question for Beth or Renee: This will help us ensure that we accurately determine if Forcible Entry has crossed an economic nexus threshold in states other than Washington or California. The reports Renee shared are sales-tax-focused and likely won't work for states without tax collection (yet). Could we utilize the Zamp Sales Tax Report (which is a 'Invoice List' custom report) and follow the steps below, in the interest of maintaining consistency with cash-based accounting? Or, is there a better report to use so we can view all invoice payments in any state other than California or Washington?"

Is there a set period or limit of any kind? 4) Are there any transaction types in QuickBooks Online that we should also include in Zamp other than Credit Memos and Invoices? 5) Outside of the above approach, would it be acceptable to utilize the invoice list report for any states where Forcible Entry does not yet have nexus and isn't collecting sales tax? The goal here would be to avoid creating separate transactions within Zamp for the partial payments associated with these transactions. Doing the above could artificially inflate the economic nexus threshold counts because some states have both an ""order count"" threshold and a dollar threshold."

Please email the exact questions you have and I will try to answer them. I know what Quickbooks shows as received payments are always correct and matched properly to invoices. You created a report based on $0 balances for receivables and as I told Zamp before, that won't be accurate. Clients pay partial payments, sometimes they pay invoices from a year prior. I am not a Quickbooks report expert, but I will definitely try to help as much as I can and know about:) Thanks! Renee"

Would you happen to have time next week to meet and review our findings on the differences between the sales tax liability report and the custom invoice list export we built within QuickBooks Online? We're finding that there are transactions within the sales tax liability report that are not included in the invoice list export, and vice versa. This is likely a quirk of QuickBooks Online, or maybe it's tied to some setting or situation that we're unaware of, but we've been unable to identify the cause. We'd love to work together to resolve this situation and find the best path forward for simplifying sales tax compliance and ensuring accurate sales tax filings. Please use this link to schedule a call or share your availability, and we can send a calendar invite."

An accrual-basis export of the CA sales tax liability report. All of the Q2 2025 Invoices are in an export. The issues we've found are: The CA liability reports do not match the invoice exports, regardless of whether we filter for a $0 balance or not ($0 balance is supposed to be a cash-basis account). This likely isn't an issue with how amounts, invoices, balances, etc, are handled by accounting folks. We believe this is a display or logic issue with QBO itself. We need to: Determine the source of this issue, which is likely to be within QuickBooks Online. Determine how to proceed with the filings. We're past the internal filing deadlines, but CA is a later-in-the-month state, so we could get this sorted out before filing and still file on time."

I hope things improve and settle down (in a good way) on your end, sooner rather than later! After fixing the 'overpaid tax' adjustment for California, the new estimated tax due is $58,462. The other state's differences are typically due to the usual reasons associated with rounding, timely filing discounts (e.g., GA or VA), time-zone differences (Shopify operates in PST, while Zamp files in PST, EST, CST, MST, etc.), and the items noted in this article . The other cause for differences will be the overpaid tax adjustments for IL, GA, and VA. We'll dig into the gross sales differences you noted between Zamp and Shopify for California and follow up as soon as we have more information. This is likely to be next week, or the week after (if we escalate to engineering). Have a wonderful evening!"

I understand where you're coming from, and I'll be sure to share this feedback with the broader Zamp team. We're continually improving and will handle these situations better in the future. I'm glad to hear this simplifies the TX rates for you! I understand the concern. In this situation, and because Zamp is designed to remit only the tax that is collected, it shouldn't raise any unusual audit concerns or red flags on the state's side. If that does happen, please let us know and we'll do our best to assist."

The taxability of shipping varies from state to state, and in all kinds of scenarios; we're here to help with that. Labor may or may not be taxable depending on the kind of service involved. What types of services would you be referring to? We have a few that might fit this kind of category, but this may also be something to run by our Tax Research team for confirmation. These are the categories we currently support: The "" TPP "" below refers to "" Tangible Personal Property "", which is generally taxable products. Regarding the PDF you shared and CCF_000129: I reviewed this further and also triple-checked some items within your Zamp account for your Texas sales tax registration. I found that when Zamp registered Accelerated Tooling LLC in Texas, we registered you with a 'Single Local Tax Rate' license type in that state. This is similar to other simplified sales tax rate licenses and programs in different states, and it's typically used by out-of-state businesses. The Single Local Tax Rate for Texas with this type of sales tax registration is 8% on all transactions, regardless of the shipping address. For this order and considering shipping taxable, $3.36 would be 8% of $42.00 . This means that a single sales tax rate is collected on orders shipping to customers within Texas, and here are some resources about this: Under ' How to Collect Sales Tax on Interstate Texas Sales ' in our Texas Sales Tax Guide, here . On the TX Comptroller's page here . I hope this helps, and please let us know if we can assist with anything!"

After reviewing the tax calculation logs on our end associated with the WooCommerce store here, I'm seeing a few different Tax Due amounts returned by our API for this zip code on 7/4/25 Within Zamp's API logs, I can see 6 calculations with a subtotal of $24 and $0 shipping cost. Then, I also see a final sales tax calculation with a subtotal of $24 and a $18 shipping cost. I'd like to see how the order looks on your end because Zamp would consider shipping to be taxable in Texas, and that might be the cause of the difference here. A few questions: 1) Was this order placed on 7/4/25? 3) Could you also please share a screenshot of the order from within WooCommerce with me?

These sales are being attributed to California and artificially triggering nexus, even though the end customer address is located elsewhere and they have not actually met nexus thresholds in CA. Could you please advise on the best path forward to ensure the customer’s shipping address—rather than eBay’s California authentication address—is used for nexus determination? Specifically: Is it possible to adjust the mapping within the eBay integration to reflect the actual customer address? If not, would you recommend the customer use CSV uploads instead to ensure accurate reporting? Is there any other workaround available that allows us to continue using the eBay integration while resolving this? Appreciate your help in looking into this! Thank you, Caroline"

I just got back and I think there has been a bit of a misunderstanding - the B2B transactions need to be recalculated as well with Zamp. This is because we collect on the state portion only for B2B and eat the rest of the cost so we can't rely on the tax collected field for B2B either. We'll need to update the returns to reflect this. Can we chat sometime this week to set an action plan for fixing this? Cheers, Bill"

That sounds like a good plan to me, and we'll have until mid-next week to move the filings along in the process. A quick note: We recalculated the tax for the B2C sales because tax was already collected on all of the B2B sales within your nexus states. After fixing a bit of detail with the currency conversion (utilizing a conversion rate of 1.37), the amount due is lower, but there is now an amount owing for Iowa. On our end, we show tax being calculated as out of pocket for LumiQ, which is: $113.52 in Ohio. $69.86 in Iowa. Have a wonderful weekend and enjoy your OOO time!"

Yeah I do think now that the source of confusion is that we told the onboarding team this - but there must have been some crossed wires during implementation/support. Basically, we don't collect sales tax on the CSV upload (B2C) transactions because it's so small and we eat the cost.

The reason is because Zamp is pulling the Sales Tax Collected field but we have been very open from the start that we are not collecting on certain components of sales tax and eating the cost ourselves.

However, when comparing Zamp with the customer's assigned RevRec amount, there is a small difference. Important: The customer is comparing the tax amount from Marketplace and return transactions using a line-item file. Key Findings: The discrepancy primarily stems from Amazon transactions (the customer added a column in the file to identify the 'source' ) For regular transactions, the difference is 44.77. After transforming the export into an order-level file and aggregating returns with regular transactions, here’s the summary: Transaction Type Zamp - Shopify Shopify - RevRec Zamp - RevRec Marketplace 0 -186.78 -186.78 Regular 22.77 22 44.77 It would be important to check with the customer why they are not using tax in their comparison for these Amazon transactions. Customer Source Zamp - Shopify Shopify - RevRec Zamp - RevRec Amazon 1.17 42.36 43.53 Others 0 0 0 subscription_contract 9.81 -9.81 0 web 11.79 -10.55 1.24"

When we export orders from BigCommerce and compare them to Zamp, we find amounts that vary from what you shared and from what Zamp has as the tax-due estimate for this month (June 2025 and Q2 2025 filings). That said, and because Dorm Company has a Florida filing, we're right up against an internal deadline (end of the day today, 7/16) to ensure that Florida and other states are filed on time. A few questions: 1) Would it be OK with you if we proceed with filings as they are this month, with the tax-due estimated and listed on the 7/7/25 email? This will enable us to ensure timely filing and also provide additional time for review and troubleshooting. Then, if we find the cause, we can account for the difference in future filing periods (e.g., July 2025 filed in August, or Q3 2025 filed in October). 2) When you have a moment, could you please share any files, supporting work, or links to the review you (or your team) did of the tax amounts that were collected? This can help us compare further, and we should be able to find the root cause. One way or another, we'll get this sorted out. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions regarding the above."

To confirm, were those totals based on a combination of the transactions and data from within BigCommerce? Are there any other sources? Everything should be through BigCommerce or Square, as Amazon collects and remits as a Marketplace Facilitator. The Square transactions that we see from June were from TN and TX. There are some timely filing discounts included in our estimates, but they aren't large enough to account for these variances. I definitely see what you're referring to with the amounts being low. We'll investigate this further on Monday, while comparing it to BigCommerce data. Just to be safe, the total for tax collected for California for Q2 (which I believe is April 1st - June 30th, correct me if I'm wrong) was $7,571.13. Does California need to be rechecked? This is interesting to hear, as CA should likely also have a larger amount. Here are some details for CA's Q2 2025 filing, as Zamp's tax-due estimates now fully account for the quarterly prepayments made in CA: 1st Prepayment - $2,073.00 2nd Prepayment - $1,748.00 Total Prepayments - $3,821.00 We see a total tax collected in CA of $5,757.00 , which is lower than your estimate.

That said, we (Zamp) would need to know which specific transactions are ones that occurred through the Shop sales channel within Shopify; there are a few ways to determine this: In the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report, these transactions are categorized under the ""Filed by Channel"" category, as Shopify shares here . In an order export from Shopify, the ""Channel"" is noted as ""Shop"". Then, within Zamp, we would treat these transactions as marketplace transactions with a designation of ""SHOPIFY"" to ensure tax is not remitted twice. Do you have any Shopify channel-related details being funneled into the system, through which these reports are built? we are not paying sales tax twice This could be the case, but I'm unable to know for sure, as the data provided to Zamp doesn't indicate if the transaction occurred through the Shop channel or not. Do you see any SHOP channel transactions in any of the data provided since 1/1/25? If you'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss this further, please use this link . We want to ensure data accuracy here and collaborate on the best path forward."

We looked into this further, and we've confirmed that we see the following California prepayment amounts within your CA CDTFA account: Prepayment 1 - $13,517.14 Prepayment 2 - $16,714.24 The tax-due estimate sent earlier this month did not account for those prepayment amounts; however, our filing team will take these into account when filing the return. The above means that the amount Zamp would estimate to be filed would be closer to $21,395.62 after subtracting those prepayments. Please note that, since New York follows a fiscal quarter (e.g., Q2 is June 2025 through August 2025), Zamp's tax-due estimate for NY would be considered the first prepayment associated with the NY Q2 2025 sales tax filing. A few questions: 1) Considering the above, do we have your approval to proceed with ETERNE's filings this month? 2) Regarding NY—if you'd like us to confirm the prepayment and filing amounts for this state, could you please reset or update your NY password and share it with us? We were unable to log in due to an expired password here. The password could be shared securely using this one-time secret tool."

Please could you also confirm receipt of the request to switch the Shopify Zamp connection back to the live Zamp account this Friday ? Yes—we will switch the Shopify Zamp connection back the production Zamp account and I've set a reminder on my end to ensure this is completed tomorrow morning (7/11/25.) Please can you confirm orders look correct in Zamp? Yes—the orders look correct within Zamp. After further investigation and comparison, I found that the order count difference was due to: Shopify does not create separate refund Transactions (it's noted within the order), but Zamp does create separate refund and order transactions. This happens because Zamp utilizes a ledger-based accounting approach, which creates a clear line of separation between orders and refunds. Some orders were not synced to the Zamp Sandbox account because they had order dates before the initial sync range (in April 2025); the initial sync was 5/1/25 and forward. After resyncing transactions, the order count totals match, when accounting for separate refunds. And also confirm the UK time window you'll be switching the Shopify connection to your live instance? Sure! What UK time window would be best for you all here? I usually start my day around 9 AM EST (1 PM UK time), but we can also target  a later time up to 11 PM EST (4 AM UK time) if that's better. Otherwise we can check with the broader team to see if anyone has a different availability. Please let us know if you have any questions."

Most of the differences appear to be related to the following items: Timely filing discounts in each state. Our tax-due estimates automatically account for these. For CO, this discount is $93.96 For SC, this discount is $11.72. Rounding NC appears to fall into this category, and possibly time zones as well. Time zone differences between Stripe and Zamp: Zamp would file using EST in NC and SC. We'll file using MST in CO. We see these kinds of differences commonly with Shopify, but similar logic would apply to Stripe, depending on the time zone used in Stripe's reports/views.

We have a new tax-due estimate heading your way within the next few minutes. We have identified the cause of this issue, which was related to a data processing error on our part; the amounts have been adjusted overall. That said, South Carolina now has an estimated tax-due amount. We're putting items and improvements in place to avoid this in the future. We've triple-checked the data and compared it against your Stripe account as well. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I've broken down the details and responses into separate categories below, based on your findings and our following review. A tax-due estimate will be sent out shortly. Transactions that we adjusted: After we looked into this further, we found that some of the transactions (listed below) did need adjustments, likely due to partial refunds or order edits. 7224535154750 7236358078526 7235996418110 7235996418110 Transactions we found did not need adjustment: 1) The transaction noted below wasn't showing up in a Shopify export or report because in Shopify, it has a date of 5/31/25 at 9:09 PM, and in Zamp, the date is adjusted for the state's time zone to 6/1/25 at 4:09 AM. 7189832761406 2) The transaction noted below was sold through Shopify's SHOP Marketplace (specifically, the Shop app) and Zamp automatically marks these transactions with $0 tax because SHOP is acting as a Marketplace Facilitator for this transaction and remits the tax collected to the relevant state; Shopify shares more details about that here . 7210012540990 (aka, HOS4524612118 ) A note about this is displayed in Shopify here when reviewing the specific order. 3) The transactions noted below are related to Shopify orders that had refunds.

We'll need to work on an offset file for the transactions involved here. The update transaction functionality isn't yet released in Admin as far as I can tell (that project is still in progress here .) For marketplace transactions, I believe we can clarify that we report them as $0 tax since Shopify handles the collection and remittance as a marketplace facilitator. Our integration automatically accounts for these transactions. This applies to the order IDs below and won't need adjustment: 7210012540990 (aka, HOS4524612118) in Shopify here . I thought there were two transactions, but she shared this one twice. We purposely zero-out the tax on these marketplace transactions; they might not be aware of that. I can follow up with them tomorrow once we've imported the offset file."

We can also notify them that for now, voided invoice handling, and increased accuracy, we'll handle this via a manual import instead of our existing QBO integration. When I leave 'Credit Memos' in this QBO Custom Report (Zamp Sales Tax Review) , we have a lower total for Q2 2025. Still, if I remove the 'transaction type' credit memo filter, the amount matches the customer's gross sales expectations in the note above . Would you like to tackle that, or should I contact them?

We can assume that if the transaction was imported without errors and shows up on the transactions page , it was included. That said, I do see the county associated with that transaction (from looking up Elon University's address ) on the NC report, but it splits the county tax from the state tax, so it doesn't match the full amount (if that makes sense). We can dive deeper using the variance reviewing query here , and look for the transaction's ID in the export (columns A or B for externalName/externalId.) I did this and confirmed the transaction was listed, which means we calculated taxes for it and bucketed it into the NC report/summary. We should be fine here, as far as I know! :)"

The city rate increased by 0.75% on April 1, 2025. We captured the code change but not the rate change. I've updated our FIRE table and the update will be visible next time we load the data (I'm not sure when that will be because we are doing updates in the next couple of weeks). 1) Is the 10.5% or 11.25% rate correct here? 11.25% is correct. 2) If the 10.5% rate is correct, is this related to something with out-of-state sellers, CA, and district or other taxes that might not apply? N/A 3) What might have caused this, and how can we fix it? This is just an oversight. We capture about 95%-97% of the updates but, inevitably, something slips through.

I'll share some details below that I believe will help ensure we're on the same page. :) I want to make sure that whichever way we do it Zamp is calculating the correct tax amount that has been collected ans should be remitted. Agreed! I want to confirm this as well. The good news here is that Zamp's Shopify integration has logic in place that can look for either handling of US sales taxes: Tax exclusive - tax listed separately. Tax inclusive - tax included in the product price. As if the system assumes we are including it in the price in the USA, but we are now adding it to the price, then the system may be calculating the wrong numbers To my understanding and review, Zamp will be able to detect whether the Shopify transaction has tax included in the price, or if it's now added to the price (separately). Meaning—our system's calculations will differ, depending on whether Shopify tells us how the tax is included in the price or not. Our Shopify integration (system) will handle both situations and calculate correctly from there. As i understand it in both cases Shopify itemises the tax collected out into a line in the order so would assume the system should just be looking at this ""tax total"" line? Yes—we do look at the 'tax total' line, and we also look for a property the Shopify API provides us with called taxesIncluded , and our integration handles it from there (Based on if this is 'true' or 'false'). I hope this helps!"

Could you please share more about why this might be the wrong approach here? I just want to ensure we're on the same page, as I may have misunderstood when you noted the following. We recently updated our settings on the 26th June so that tax is now charged at checkout instead of included from the order total. When I review your Zamp account's transactions from April 1, 2025, to June 25, 2025, I see that Zamp is bucketing transactions with tax collected across various date ranges and states. My understanding is that the tax was included in the cost of items sold. I also see tax collected from June 26, 2025, to June 30, 2025. After reviewing the code related to our Shopify integration, I found that we support tax-inclusive pricing (included in the item's cost), which was introduced late last year. That said, it is correct that the best and most compliant approach is to list sales tax separately (also known as tax-exclusive pricing, where the tax is not included in the item's cost). This compliance piece focuses more on complying with sales tax regulations than on reporting and filing. We'll continue to hold Drool Arts filings this month as we discuss this further. However, please keep in mind that we need to have the various state filings moving along in the process by the end of the day tomorrow (7/16/25) to ensure timely filing."

We can fast-track the investigation here, considering the critical meeting on Monday, as we'd like to ensure we handle this in the way that best helps you. Regarding Pennsylvania: The tax-due estimate for Pennsylvania is $201.23, which includes a timely filing discount in PA. Here's the breakdown: We see a total tax collected of $203.32. There is a timely filing discount in PA of $2.03. The remainder of the difference ($0.06) appears related to rounding within the sales tax logic; these slight differences can happen due to the nature of sales tax. Regarding Michigan: Within Zamp, I found that $137.59 in tax was collected for customers located in Michigan.. The reason Zamp is noting that $1.40 is due is due to two reasons: There is a timely filing discount in MI of $2.80 (the full tax due Zamp calculated is $4.20 .) Within Zamp, our system is designed to view digital products (R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS) as tax-exempt in Michigan, which means we'd expect $0 tax to be collected on those transactions. This means that we see $133.39 of the $137.59 tax collected as over-collection. We have the option here to ask our filing team to file the $137.59 amount instead of the $1.40 (less any timely filing discounts). Then, later this month, we could schedule a meeting or discuss via email to determine why more tax was collected than Zamp would expect. Would you like me to ask our filing team to file the $137.59, less any timely filing discounts, in MI? Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I've looked into this further and we don't currently see any WooCommerce Transactions within your Zamp account. This may not be an issue, as you noted they're syncing to WooCommerce. However, I have a few questions to help us ensure everything is aligning as it should be. 1) What was the WooCommerce Order ID and zip code for the test Alabama transaction? 2) Do you happen to know what this WooCommerce order should show up as within QuickBooks? What is the invoice number? Was this related to Invoice 461 with the name 'Test' with a Ship To address in Foley, AL? Ideally, we'll also ensure that there aren't duplicate transactions between QuickBooks Online and WooCommerce."

If you have any questions at any point, please let us know. A quick sales data question here: 1) Do you expect to have transactions with tax collected syncing to Zamp up to today (7/11)? 2) Or do the transactions flow into QuickBooks Online, and should Zamp expect to capture the sales data that way? We're asking the above questions because we haven't yet seen data flow into Zamp from your WooCommerce store. While this may be expected, we want to be sure and offer to assist if that should not be the case. Have a great weekend!"

My understanding of this situation is that they're getting things configured, testing, etc. I don't think they would have gone live this quickly (in 4-5 days). I'm seeing the same transactions, no WooCommerce: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clvvery8u00sut0fz78at8nr4/transactions Looks like this customer approved filings on 7/1/25, I think their sales are low while this website isn't live, as this is in line with previous month filings: https://secure.helpscout.net/conversation/2959176526/141300 I'll check though!"

I asked Jam to run a report on who was using Woo and it looks like this customer was the only other one besides the ones in ONB that we're aware of or who might not be pulling in the data via CSV already. Do you know if they tried to connect the integration already? I don't see orders flowing in at all from the integration which is why I wanted to call it out

A few questions, though: 1) Is there a different file for June 2025, as this file is titled for May? If not, do you know which Order IDs are from June or where the transition between months is? The goal here is to avoid importing duplicate partial refunds and ensure we're all on the same page. We can run a comparison here, later this week or after the July 4th holiday, if you're unsure. 2) In the future, can we add the Shopify order's Ship To zip code? We can determine this from the Shopify order's ID through multiple exports, but this would significantly speed up the process and reduce the likelihood of human error."

Please let us know if this helps! 1) The CA amount ($379.29) aligns with the taxes collected in June, but Q2 should be much higher? Yes—the amount Zamp estimates will be remitted to the state (paid/due) should align with the June 2025 tax collected amounts, and this is what we see occur with clients who California has assigned a quarterly Prepay filing frequency. This happens because our tax-due estimate already accounts for the prepayments made for Otteroo in CA: 1st Prepayment - $459.00 2nd Prepayment - $458.00 Total Prepayments - $917.00 2) Is WA is higher than what I see in shopify due to B&O tax? Yes—this should be due to the B&O tax in Washington, as that amount is $21.90 for Q2 2025. 3) Maryland in Shopify (for all of 2024) is about $130 higher than what I see on zamp Just so you know, part of this difference is likely due to a timely filing discount of $5.42; however, this only accounts for a portion of the discrepancy. Overall, this difference is likely due to the date range associated with the MD filing frequency assigned to Otteroo by the MD Department of Revenue, which is a Fiscal Annual filing frequency that covers the period from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. When you have a moment, could you please confirm the following items with us to help with this investigation? The date range associated with the MD Transaction review in Shopify. A screenshot or copy of an export from Shopify for MD is being used to compare here. We'll also hold Otteroo's filings until we have approval to proceed, due to the questions here, as we want to ensure timely and accurate filing. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

We've made the necessary updates to adjust by an amount close to what you noted and shared in the Shopify vs Zamp comparison file. The overall adjustment we made was -$2,700.53 because the majority of the Washington Q2 2025 difference was due to WA's Business & Occupation tax (B&O), which is a gross receipts tax, not collected from customers. We include this amount in our tax-due estimate. The B&O Tax amount for Q2 2025 was $518.80 , while the difference you noted was $690.03. This means that we adjusted WA by $171.23. We're sending an updated tax-due estimate along with an increased review window time, within the next few minutes. Please let us know if you have any questions."

We can certainly understand your perspective, and we would like to partner with you to resolve this situation. A slight difference, such as 1.25% (even if the dollar amount seems high), is very likely related to time zone differences between Zamp and Shopify. Zamp's tax-due estimate and filings will use the US time zone that aligns with the state's capital, meaning we use EST, CST, MST, PST, Hawaiian Time, and Alaskan Time across the various states. We'll dive into this further and confirm if the difference is related to time zones. If that's the case, our recommendation would be against adjusting by this amount, as it would mean not remitting tax to the various states. If time zones aren't the cause, we'll find the root cause and work with you to adjust the data accordingly. We should have more details to share or questions by early next week. Have a great weekend!"

However, we can conduct a quick comparison using the Zampboni tools that Lucas built to confirm whether the issue is related to time zone differences or something similar. If that's the case, then we can provide a quick explanation. If it's not, and we can determine the root cause, we can adjust. I'll hold their filings here. https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/38934726/card_tables/cards/8813898594"

If you delete the transaction now, we can manually import a refund version of this transaction to account for it. Ultimately, the transaction could be left as it is so that the original data used to file for Virginia remains intact. Then, when we manually create the refund for this transaction, we can note on the line item description that this is a refund because the transaction was canceled, never shipped, and refunded. Does the above work well for you here? The 4 day window provided (truly 3 with the holiday) is really tight. Is there any way to expand that? We appreciate your feedback and understand your perspective. We'll share this with the broader team and consider any possibilities. The tricky portion of these situations is that the state filing due dates (each state's deadlines) don't change to account for holidays, and Zamp's filing timeframe and approval windows are designed to ensure we file timely for all Zamp customers, while optimizing for efficiency across teams."

I'm following up to note that we were able to account for the below invoices that were voided/refunded: SS15179 SS15730 That said, there is a larger population of voided invoices that we're unable to account for due to low or $0 tax collected in the state(s) associated with the transaction. The reason for this is that Zamp is unable to file negative amounts in any state or any state's local jurisdiction. We're currently developing a plan to move forward and track the remaining voided transactions in future filing periods. I'll also share a list with you so that we're all on the same page. We will also be following up about some duplicate transactions in our other email thread (with the subject ""Re: Incorrect NY filing""). For now, we will be sending out the tax-due estimate to ensure timely filing, as Florida is due on the 20th, but has some complex rules regarding payment submission.

Since it was included in the filing, is there a way to get a credit for the overpaid amount? It may be possible to do this within the current filings this month.

This was the situation Carie and Ashley had reached out about. Did we still want to work through finding a way to address the sales tax remittance associated with that invoice?"

For Invoice 9134 - I think I found the same thing, trying to look up if we had filed tax for this one with AZ or CA (CA being the correct billing address). I don't know why it was skipped in the sync but, all in all for the best since we ended up not collecting on it either way. For Invoice 9259 - I'm not sure why you can't access this one, no liability to adjust if we didn't pre-emptively pay tax but does raise concern about the integration if this invoice isn't accessible to Zamp. Hopefully this isn't happening on a larger scale but I will keep an eye on this. For Invoice 9007 - if we are carrying the ""overpayment"" until the tax filed is higher than that amount, is this just something you'll be returning to each month? Thank you again, Allie"

I wanted to follow up to note that we couldn't find the below invoices (these were voided) within Zamp: 9134 - This one appears in QuickBooks Online, but not in Zamp; we're unsure why it didn't sync, as the original logs would have been more than 30-60 days old. 9259 - This one wasn't found within QuickBooks Online or Zamp, unless it's one we don't have access to within QBO, or it's in a different subsidiary/account. I searched a date range of 1/1/24-7/15/25 in attempts to find the invoices noted above within Zamp. The invoice noted below is a voided invoice that we were unable to account for because the specific local jurisdictions within MN that are involved, had sales except for the ST Paul City (Ramsey County) jurisdiction; meaning, a refund for the voided transaction would cause it to become negative and states don't allow negative amounts in their filings. 9007 For invoice 9007, we recommend including it next month, and we can re-evaluate each month as we move forward to determine if it can be accounted for. We were able to account for these voided invoices and recover the tax refunded: 9439 9126 I hope this helps, and please let me know if there are any questions!"

(There are no entirely new Gamefound transactions for June, but make sure you saw the new BackerKit transactions on the previous email which are new June transactions.) My thought is that we should therefore show 10 June transactions, 5 which are reversals/credits of the original May transactions, and 5 of which are the ""rebilled"" transactions. Do you need me to add the 5 reversals to this spreadsheet as well, or is the 5 transactions in their ""new form"" enough? Or alternatively, do you have any thoughts on a better way to handle these? Sean"
2986304928,151367,9120643867,customer,2025-07-10T14:48:10Z,slabbe@earthbornegames.com,"Hi Chris, Just about done... So as I said, there are two pieces to this for June. First, the final wave from the old BackerKit for Minnesota sales. That's the easy part - attached in a spreadsheet. Second, the Gamefound. I expected that once I finished my transforms, which cross-reference the current state of the Gamefound data against what we have recognized as sales to date, I would show no new activity in June. I was right, except for five anomalous transactions that are showing me weird numbers. Investigating these, the best I can tell, these are orders that had to get redirected to an updated address at the last second, after we'd already given our warehouse the go-ahead to ship (and recognized the sale). The new address means the tax rate changed in Gamefound's system, and there's now additional sales tax on the orders from what there was when we previously reported them in May. But it also means we reported the sale in May to a state that is not the state where we got the product to in the end. And Gamefound's data doesn't make this clean for us - they don't give us a reverse sale in the original state and a new sale in the new state. They just make the edit and show us the final version. That's the problem with Gamefound reporting - anything new that happens to an order just changes the order, regardless of the date of the order, so it looks like the order has been that way since the beginning. There's no concept of a period closing or a change order to a transaction, just an unauditable edit. It doesn't even show you what the original ship-to state was - we have to cross-reference that in our data. The way these crowdfunding sites work means there's always going to be some weird error like this that creeps in and we won't report things like sales tax perfectly. Anyway, for these five transactions, on our end, I suppose the cleanest thing we can do is try to show a reverse sale at the original address and a new sale in the new address. I will get you the info on these five shortly..."

This will possibly be the final batch of BackerKit data ever, unless we end up returning to BackerKit one day. The second will potentially be a new batch of Gamefound data for all states .

I checked a few customer QBO accounts (billboards, LumiQ, Forcible Entry), and those accounts still have options like the ones below with the addresses that we need: Shipping Address Ship To Billing Address Bill To We accomplish this through a custom report in QBO, typically based on the invoice list report that he mentioned. Additionally, it doesn't appear to be a QBO-wide change from a quick review, but rather an issue specific to their account. They may need to contact QuickBooks (Intuit) support by following the steps in this Intuit article . The report we usually use: The columns: This article shares some details about adding columns like this to a report, but as far as I can tell, it should be the same process they used: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/customize-reports/create-custom-reports-quickbooks-online-advanced/L1LHo5Ti2_US_en_US Maybe we can ask him to add integrations@zamp.com as an accountant user in QBO?

The situation with the rates returned here was related to what happened with Colorado. Overall, Colorado, South Dakota, and Indiana were affected. 2) Noted regarding the usage of the Google address autocomplete here, as that would certainly explain the difference between the two addresses and zip codes. We highly recommend Smarty, and I'd forgotten that it was already implemented on your end (from our earlier call). 3) Perfect! At the time of my initial response, I was unaware of the underlying reason for the behavior we were seeing, and my initial guesses were incorrect. I also see the taxes object included in the API request with either the 46241-55 74 or 46241-55 34 zip codes. We should be all set here now.

} To improve the tax calculations in scenarios like the above, we'd recommend either implementing address validation API calls to Zamp's /addresses API endpoint or a similar solution. That said, I believe we could improve the API response handling in situations like this; I'll ensure this is raised with our engineering team. Regarding the Lincoln Way West address and ID 9ffb7a5e-209f-4e71-9827-978ba706f105: I was unable to find any tax calculation requests to our /calculations endpoint from June 25, 2025, through June 29, 2025, for the address noted below. I believe it happened and am just attempting to trace the behavior here before sending this over to our engineering team. 525 Lincoln Way W, South Bend, IN 46601 Part of the reason I'm mentioning the above and the question below is that I'm now seeing tax rates and a taxDue amount returned for this address: {

} A few questions: 1) For the  Lincoln Way West address, did the tax calculation request with a taxDue amount occur before 6/25/25? If so, this would make sense, as the logging improvement on our end was released on June 25, 2025, and I wouldn't have access to those logs. 2) Do you all have an address validation service that you already use? There are still a few items here that I'd like to escalate to our engineering team to determine the cause of this behavior and ensure the root cause is identified and resolved. The answers to the questions above will help ensure we have sufficient context for this situation. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Our Engineering Team investigated and resolved the situation with Colorado here last night. What happened here was an unexpected edge case (which had not occurred in the past) when our teams were loading updated tax rate data as a part of one of the quarterly tax data updates. Our teams are also working to implement additional testing and processes to prevent this from happening in the future. Now, we are seeing the full rate returned for an address after triple-checking via internal tools and our API. Here are some screenshots noting this: The tax rates noted above also match the Colorado Sales Tax Lookup Tool here : Please note that Zamp's tax rates will align with the CO's General Merchandise (Tangible Personal Property) rates, as listed in the Sales Tax Lookup Tool. The 'General Merchandise - Use Tax' rates are tied to consumer use tax rates (for individual consumers or businesses ), instead of sales tax. I hope this helps.

We would like to request a ""refund"" for the California sales tax prior to early June using the following approaches: Could you assist with refiling the 2025-Q2 California sales tax to ensure that shipping charges are treated as tax-exempt? This would help us avoid both issuing a refund and paying unnecessary tax on shipping. Do you have any recommended method for claiming a refund on the 2025-Q1 California sales tax charged on shipping, given that shipping should be treated as tax-exempt? Sincerely, Hanna"

According to California tax regulations, should sales tax on Shipping & Handling charges be collected before early June? No—to our understanding , Shipping itself or Shipping & Handling when combined (not stated separately) is generally considered tax-exempt within California; this includes before early June 2025. Specifically, do we need to refund the Shipping & Handling tax for orders delivered to California prior to the beginning of June? Ultimately, the decision here is up to you (or the business). The taxes need to either be remitted to the state or refunded to the customer. If you decide to refund the tax on shipping to customers, please let us know, and we'll make sure it is accounted for in future sales tax filings processed for California. I'm noting this as we've seen businesses decide to handle this in many different ways, partly because processing refunds for every customer in scenarios like this is not always an easy undertaking. If you'd like to schedule a call with me and TheWayo's account manager, please let me know, and we'll share a link (after this upcoming US holiday). Please let us know if you have any questions!"

After further investigation and review of internal situations associated with this discrepancy, we found that the difference in tax calculated was due to an improvement needed within Zamp regarding the taxability of Shipping & Handling in California. Our Engineering and Tax Research teams released the improvement to fix this, towards the beginning of June. Earlier in June 2025, and some cases before that month, Zamp was calculating tax on shipping for customers located in California. The above means that the Zamp API tax calculation response on June 30, 2025, is the correct and most up-to-date, accurate calculation. This also means that Shipping & Handling will be treated as tax-exempt by the Zamp API at this time. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

The difference here likely relates to how line items are provided to Zamp within the initial API request, but we'll confirm. A few questions: 1) To help us troubleshoot and review this further, could you please share the API request and responses for both the tax calculation and transaction creation associated with order #CP-0725-9122? The good news here is that we recently, and internally, released a significant API logging improvement as of June 25, 2025, so we shouldn't need API request/response examples from that date forward. 2) Also, are there any more recent examples of this discrepancy? I'll also review our logs to find examples of this behavior, but the answers to the questions above will help expedite the process."

2975444259,148536,9052787223,customer,2025-06-19T20:58:57Z,renee@bizisblooming.com,"Hello! As I am reviewing the numbers for Chuck. I still have concerns. Just for California, in April I showed $9,493.71 was due based on taxes charged and collected as they are Cash Basis, not accrual as per the balance sheet. You made a tax payment of $2428. In May, there was another $3,547.25 tax collected bringing the current total balance of $13040.96 due, for the remainder of April and May taxes collected. Your recent report shows just over $11.2k due for May alone. When Zamp was hired, part of the agreement I believed was making sure Quickbooks was charging and collecting taxes appropriately and everything was flowing properly. There are taxes on the books for other states, so are those being incorrectly charged or not being filed/paid? Bloom originally invited Zamp to be an accountant user in February 2025. This invitation was not accepted and another was sent yesterday which was accepted. Something is still not right which leads me to believe the taxes on invoices are perhaps not correct? Please follow up with Chuck and verify with him that the correct taxes are being charged and collected. Your reports should always match (maybe off a few pennies) what the balance sheet shows. As he receives payments in Quickbooks, it allocates the portion to sales and tax based on his invoices.

Our accounting team has been reviewing the transaction list and trying to reconcile it against what we see in Zamp and QuickBooks, and I wanted to share a few findings to get your thoughts. Two invoices (SS15043 & SS14457) are missing entirely from the transaction list. The Zamp export totals $88,499.49, but a large chunk of that is made up of what look like duplicate entries. When we remove all the duplicates, the total drops to $28,841.50. Zamp, however, shows a collected total of $31,350.90, so we're seeing a $2,500 discrepancy. We have also cross-checked against our NY QuickBooks account. Everything marked in green on the sheet has been matched.

Thank you for the follow-up and for providing this data. *1)* OK, noted, and this makes sense to us. *2)* Normally, we would be able to include these additional orders in the tax calculations for the most recent reporting cycle, with filings due this month, July 2025.

You'll notice in the spreadsheet that there are now duplicate lines for refunded orders/line items. The original order line items are in green, the refunded line items are highlighted in red. These should cancel each other out. 2. Could these orders be uploaded/added for sales tax calculations on your end for the most recent reporting cycle (June / quarterly / semi-annual)? Could we then receive the typical email report with updated tax liability figures for each state? 3. How would we go about adjusting for the previous month of May? The sum is going to be pretty small ($0.88 + $1.16 of tax across 2 orders). 4. Starting next month, the spreadsheet we send over will only have July orders, does that work for you? Will we need to send a separate spreadsheet at the end of each quarter / semi-annually to cover those reporting cycles as well? Thanks, Aksel Hi Aksel, Apologies for the confusion, you are correct in the tax being $80.47. I was mistaken and re-did the import with the refunds as additional rows. Normally for a refund we would have an additional row with the same transaction ID with a following -1, -2, etc and negative values to offset the initial transaction. This is the process you would need to adhere to for the following CSV files sent to us.

In doing so, the total sales tax number becomes $80.47 (or the original $87.48 minus the $7.01). The spreadsheet you sent over lists the total amount as $73.46, effectively double counting the $7.01 amount.

Just to clarify a couple of points: I have attached a CSV with the breakdown for each state Are the per-state totals you sent over coming from your system and calculations or simply a filtered list from the export I had sent over? If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return > ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that > and that equals $73.46.

I think order-level information is being conflated here with item-level information: - The order in question had 2 items in it, thus the two rows for order # SO1100000219 - Column AB lists the total tax paid for the order, thus the column header ""Order tax"". The total tax paid on the order was $7.01 - Column CZ has item-level tax amounts of $3.70 and $3.31 (or $7.01 total for the whole order), these represent the amounts paid per the 2 items in the order So, shouldn't the total amount of tax be the sum of all the item-level tax amounts in CZ ($87.48) minus the two items from order # SO1100000219 ($3.70 and $3.31) which were refunded, for a total of $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31 = $80.47? Why would $7.01 be subtracted twice if it were paid once by the customer? Thanks, Aksel wrote: Hi Aksel, Thank you for your patience with this. *For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file.

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel"

If you remove the return out of the total it is $80.47, but then the return ($7.01 we use the transaction amount) in column AB is subtracted from that and that equals $73.46. In regard to the refunds, we do import those for calculations and would be good to include in future transactions list sent to us. Please let me know if you have any further questions."

To clarify, that total will be broken down per state for reporting purposes to reflect new totals for each state, correct? For instance, I'm seeing MI = $33.65 in the file. How does this compare to your MI estimate? Do you have a breakdown and similar totals comparison of what was calculated in the file vs. your rooftop-specific estimates per state (ideally with tax rate % listed for each)? I understand that it's unlikely for state-specific totals to be off when the overall tax total matches but it could happen and perhaps more importantly, we want to make sure our calculated estimates upfront are as close to correct as possible on a state by state level. One last thing to point out - we were a bit late in getting all of this going/organized so the file I sent over includes orders over several months. Just bringing this up because I know reporting per state varies (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, etc.). I also noticed there were 2 transactions that were in the returns in the > refunded column (AL), which I wasn't sure if you wanted to be included. The > tax totals with the returns factored in were both *$73.46*. When we cancel/refund a transaction, the sales tax is included in the refund so it seems to me like excluding those amounts is correct for reporting purposes, right? If so, we wouldn't want to count those. That said: - wouldn't the new total be *$80.47*? I got there with $87.48 - $3.70 - $3.31. No need to 2x the $3.70 and $3.31 since they're not listed twice in the list. - when we send you the file, we can filter the list so that credit memos/refunds are removed, would that lead to less errors potentially? Thanks, Aksel"

The estimate includes the adjustments per our usual process, and I've attached the files associated with that adjustment: The Export from Shopify with the adjustment work. The adjustment file I imported into Zamp to make those adjustments. We've completed adjusting for nearly all of the February 2025 refunds, except for ~$8.95 in tax for California. I've also attached an export from Zamp along with a comparison to the tax-due estimate. An item to note: There are some refunds for Colorado, causing a decent variance (as happened with TN, IL, VA, and CA in February.) Would you like us to adjust for this variance in the July 2025 filing? This should be doable as it's a larger sales tax month, depending on CO sales. If so, we'll remove the transaction causing this difference, and that will lower the tax-due estimate for CO."

This scenario makes sense to me as we've been working through various versions of permission-related items over the last month (or more) with other clients (in addition to some Shopify reporting changes). Can you try again and see if its working now for you? I just logged out and back in, but I still do not have the order export permissions. I'll give it a few hours and see if the order export option appears, as I know some Google services (GCP and Firebase) are experiencing a worldwide outage, which has affected Shopify as well. There could still be delays related to this as various systems are recovering or pivoting. ""Order fix View - Zamp"" --- do you only need it filtered for May 2025 only? Yep, we only need it filtered for May 2025 only because we've been adjusting based on the previous month, each time we make these adjustments (so that nothing falls through the cracks.) An update I forgot to share, related to these adjustments: Our engineering team has begun work on improvements to better handle Shopify voided and canceled orders. Once this is complete, we should only need to adjust for edited orders in the future. Our team is also revisiting the edited order situations while using a few solutions we (Technical Success) have come up with to solve for them.

This is happening because of a large refund in Illinois, which was processed on May 14, 2025, but was associated with a transaction from April 26, 2025 (Order ID #1933). This refund includes a total of $201.77 in tax that was refunded, and the Illinois jurisdiction associated with it reported $0 in sales for May 2025. The specific jurisdiction involved is CHICAGO CITY (COOK COUNTY). The reason this happens is that Illinois does not permit negative tax balances on its filings for local jurisdictions, such as Chicago. When this happens, Zamp reduces the filing for that jurisdiction to $0 (or, in this case, leaves it at $0). Would you like us to track this transaction and roll it forward in a future filing period if there are future sales to Chicago, IL, that will allow this refund to be accounted for?"

The Arizona, Louisiana, South Carolina, and West Virginia amounts are in line with the amounts Belva shared earlier this month. The SC amount is lower due to an estimated timely filing discount in SC of $20.51. The main difference here is that WA is not listed as $0 due within Zamp or QuickBooks Online after comparing the two. The amount due in WA is related to these invoices, along with a WA B&O amount of $27.51 12039 11927 Do we need to change anything for Washington here? I've attached an export from QuickBooks Online showing those invoices."

It's partially due to the corrections, which total approximately $10,450.09 for the May 2025 filing period in states where SIGMA files monthly (many are quarterly, while some are annual). Overall, this amount aligns with the total tax collected, as seen in the BigCommerce May 2025 transactions and May 2025 QuickBooks Online sales data import. This combined total for May 2025 (excluding NY, see the details below) is approximately $146,385.70. One item to note here is that New York is a quarterly filing, and NY's Q1 2025 has a date range of March 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025; NY's amount is $2,834.50. The total aligns closely with the tax-due estimate's total when accounting for rounding and time zone differences. I hope this helps, and please let us know if you have any questions!"

If Zamp hasn't yet included the voided invoice in a filing (e.g., a June 2025 invoice was voided and we haven't started filing in July yet), we can delete that invoice from Zamp; this is another option.

We're still keeping an eye on the Minnesota report and associated filing to see if this tax refund can be accounted for in the MN Q2 2025 filing. The transaction falls into St. Paul, MN, which has a local jurisdiction tax attributed to RAMSEY COUNTY TRANSIT, and that rate is 0.5%. Right now, the tax associated with this refund would be approximately $35.65, and the current tax within that jurisdiction is $14. This means that we may need to move the refund to Q3 2025 to account for MN. All that said, we'll re-evaluate as filings start in July for the Q2 2025 filing period, and we'll send another update around 7/3 or 7/7. Have a wonderful week!"

That being said, rather than adjusting that prior liability to zero now, will it work to leave that as a liability debit on the books for now, and offset our June report for Minnesota with a $395.28 credit? In this situation, we should be able to account for it in the June 2025 filing period for Minnesota as long as there is enough tax collected to cover the $395.28 amount. The reason for that is that the various states do not allow negative local jurisdiction balances on their filings. After briefly reviewing the MN Q2 2025 data, we may be able to account for this credit, depending on the amount of sales bucketed into Ramsey County, MN, once it's time to file that return. Currently, the sales volume in this county is $2,763, with a tax of $14. Otherwise, the transaction would need to be moved forward until it can be accounted for. I can investigate this further by Tuesday and will follow up with the results or any additional findings. What is the best way to approach these adjustments? What do you need from me to report voided invoices? I believe we'd want a credit memo created in QuickBooks Online, referencing the invoice that was voided by it, for this purpose. If we want to track it there, we can create one. Alternatively, we can adjust within Zamp once we've validated that there is enough sales tax in the associated local jurisdiction."

One of our employees voided an invoice today from 11/26/2024. Invoice 9007, which was already included in our sales tax report as it's reported before the customer has paid. Unfortunately, this was an invoice before we fixed the ""location of sale"" issue popping up with QBO invoices and calculation of sales tax. So this should have been MN sales tax but was recorded as Arizona sales tax. That being said, rather than adjusting that prior liability to zero now, will it work to leave that as a liability debit on the books for now, and offset our June report for Minnesota with a $395.28 credit?

For the future, what we need on our end is to know what transaction you are eliminating from your system so we can also pull that transaction and reclass it. We would need to know the Transaction ID and preferably the Total sales and the total tax amount so we can make sure we match. When the total tax did not match on that transaction to the total tax that we had in our system, that is why we questioned whether the line had the wrong transaction ID or if the line had the wrong tax amount listed. Also two of the jurisdiction names did not match from our system. We will pull the transaction from our count and will reclass it. Saman, it is okay to go in and approve Leadwork now. Thank you!"

I should have clarified in my previous email that the negative amount shown in the new Report/Export I shared represents the tax-due estimate amount that has become negative within the specified local jurisdiction, rather than the transaction's entire refund amount. Meaning—this amount is just the jurisdiction's balance becoming negative, not the full refunded tax amount for each transaction. The amounts are also broken up by jurisdiction for the transaction in question. Within Zamp, we have this transaction imported with the total tax amount as -$10.71 : In the future, I'll exclude that detail if it's preferable, and the initial goal was to illustrate the cause of the difference as negative local jurisdiction balances (while omitting a full explanation).

Would you like us to remove these transactions from the current filing period so that they can be tracked on the Batch Services side and brought into future filing periods?"

As discussed during our call on Friday, we confirmed that the timezone issue didn't affect the 2022-2024 historical data that was imported in February 2025; it was also recalculated for overdue filings in April 2025. We also reviewed the following months for Connecticut and found the causes noted below. The June 2025 CT tax-due estimate was higher due to a timezone issue. There were 23 CT Transactions with $11.53 in tax collected that were moved into June, in addition to the June 2025 transactions. The June file had $163.26 in tax collection. The combined total was $174.80 , which becomes $175.00 when applying Connecticut's rounding rules for their filings. The May 2025 tax-due estimate and tax remitted were lower due to the timezone issue. This amount was $156.75 in tax collected, which becomes $164.00 when applying CT's rounding rules for their filings. The April 2025 does appear to have been affected by the timezone issue. We're currently working on the January through April 2025 data to determine if and which transactions were also affected by this timezone issue. Once we've confirmed this, we'll update the data, share the results, and ensure that any transactions in states where Q2 2025 filings were already processed are moved forward, as we did with the May 2025 transactions. I've attached two files: a June XLSX file with tax totals by state and another XLSX file showing the May 2025 transactions that were moved into June 2025. This will help us all ensure we're on the same page. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Both Jen and Persha were OK with us doing that. Separate issue: For CT 2023 Transactions, focusing on January 2023, the following details apply. They're seeing 7.35% in tax collected in their file for Sauce Transactions. Why does the tax liability and transaction page not match? This is happening because the SaaS/subscription transactions had $0 tax and needed to be recalculated, so the liability page and transactions page won't match there. Still, the gross sales should be higher for January 2023 for Connecticut, and likely other states as well. Even by the files that Nick shared here, it should be much higher. Jen estimated a bit over $300, while the file Nick shared showed $198 just in subscription revenue. We need to triple-check the amounts and see if a file just needs to be reimported. https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cm34x4f5o01qn14lgi27uxuk8/customer-reports/liability?monthRange=2023-01~2023-01 https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cm34x4f5o01qn14lgi27uxuk8/transactions?shipToState=CT&date=2023-01-01%7E2023-01-31&limit=50 We need to: See why the gross sales are low - likely the timezone issue that we ran into for May 2025. Perhaps transactions weren't included, although they were imported, and this is related to a broader issue we've observed. We'll likely need to compare the original source files to data within Zamp."

We've found that the slight differences you noted were due to the inclusion of the time values provided with the date, in the source files we were given; we missed that piece.

The differences are definitely due to Zamp's timezone adjustments when a timestamp is included in an import file. Ideally, we could just bring the May 2025 transactions bucketed into April 2025 (4/30) into June. We'll need to update our process for Sauce to convert to short date and ensure that the time and timezone pieces aren't copied over. I'll follow up with them."

Transaction dates in the customer file are recorded at midnight (e.g., 28/05/2025 00:00:00). Our system currently converts these to the previous day (D-1), causing transactions from May 1 to be reported in April. This leads to small tax and sales differences in May reports. This does not appear to be a timezone conversion issue. If the issue is on our side , we could: Adjust Our Process: Update our import logic to convert timestamps to short dates before importing into the admin system, ensuring transactions are reported on the correct date. Alternatively, request that the customer send transaction dates as short dates (without time) in the CSV file. Escalate to the engineering team If this is simply a timezone misunderstanding , we could communicate the current logic to the customer for clarity. Data attached"

In this case, Zamp is automatically recalculating transactions created via the API. This was the default and only option for a while. Now, we support disabling this with a recalculate property, but we want to be cautious about recommending it, as it could easily be abused. We can use the Variance Reviewing Metabase query to troubleshoot situations like this and look for: A positive or negative taxDue amount where the taxCollected amount is 0. No exemption, tax code, etc, is listed. Here's an export filtered to the transactions causing this: I deleted a few columns. Eventually, I'd like to put together something more concise, query-wise."

We investigated this further and found that additional tax was remitted because Zamp files based on the tax that we'd expect to be collected when our API is used, and there was $0 tax collected on two transactions. Those two transactions were: CS-2156-0225 on 4/28/25. Zamp did not receive a tax code , customer-based entity exemption , or a purpose exemption (e.g., RESALE). CS-1437-2580 also on 4/28/25. Zamp did not receive a tax code , customer-based entity exemption , or a purpose exemption (e.g., RESALE). A few questions: 1) Do we know why the tax wasn't collected here, and a reason for not collecting the tax wasn't sent to Zamp when the transaction was created? 2) If you have any logs available from April 28, 2025, could you please share the API request and response associated with these transactions?"

When that happens, we'll file the recalculated amount (essentially, expected tax), and that was the cause of the difference, plus a bit of rounding ($0.03 as the recalculate caused $7.75 of the difference.)

This is interesting to hear because, within Zamp, we see a significantly higher amount of sales tax collected and paid for Illinois. Within Zamp, we see $1,110.12 in tax collected in IL. Zamp's tax-due estimate was $1,095.00, which included a $20 timely filing discount (also known as the 'Retailer's discount').

Additional transactions synced to Zamp between when the tax-due estimate is generated and when our filing team processes the filings.

We looked into this further and confirmed that the majority of the Connecticut tax-due estimate difference was related to missing the in-person Shopify POS Transactions. I also believe we've found the cause of this, and I'll share more details below. The other variances appear to be due to rounding, timely filing discounts (where Zamp's estimate is lower), and potentially time zone differences. We've manually imported those transactions for this month, and here's an updated tax-due estimate: State code Period Estimated sales tax AR May 2025 $57.00 CT May 2025 $1,080.00 GA May 2025 $244.31 IL May 2025 $622.00 KY May 2025 $119.07 MD May 2025 $191.41 MA May 2025 $545.89 MI May 2025 $290.93 NE May 2025 $56.70 NC May 2025 $498.03 OH May 2025 $511.97 RI May 2025 $47.14 UT May 2025 $69.81 VT May 2025 $81.03 VA May 2025 $266.49 WV May 2025 $55.25 Combined Total: $4,737.03 Question —do we now have your approval to proceed with Select Seeds' filings this month? We aim to have these moving along by the end of today, but we can hold them a bit, until the end of the day on Monday (6/16/25). The goal here is to ensure timely filing by the states' due dates. The cause of this: This issue occurred because the Zamp Shopify integration's access to your Shopify store is missing the "" read_location "" permission, a newer requirement that Shopify recently introduced. Specifically, it allows us to view the POS locations and associate those addresses with the transactions in Zamp. This permission can be added by going to: Settings —> Apps and sales channels —> click ""Develop Apps"" (in the top right) —> Zamp —> Configuration within your Shopify Admin. Then, click the ""Edit"" button next to ""Admin API integration."" Search for ""locations"" and add "" read_locations "" by checking the box. Click the black ""Save"" button. This was an item we reviewed in all Zamp customers' Shopify stores, but it was missed because there weren't POS Location sales for us to import from Select Seeds until May 2025. I'm also happy to hop on a cal l to walk through the above. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

2962376720,143242,9026435499,message,2025-06-11T14:26:32Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Kay, Thanks for your patience here! We have calculated sales tax on the price and use tax on the cost of goods. I do not see where these values are broken down on the CSV, so I am unsure where / how to enter. In this situation, the sales tax would be placed in the transactionTax column within the CSV template. At this time, Zamp does not currently support importing transactions with business use tax on the cost of goods, as Zamp's product and services are geared towards sales and use tax collected from customers. If you're referring to sales and use tax (some states call ""sales tax"" a form of ""use tax"" for out-of-state businesses), then it would belong in the transactionTax column as well (combined with sales tax). I've connected with Caroline about the business use tax piece, and this is something that could be discussed further. However, if there was an installation charge or other charge, should this also be included in the total or broken out? Yes—if there is a charge for a service or product that is tax-exempt or potentially taxed differently in various states, we'd recommend breaking that out into a separate row (with the same transactionId) on the CSV template. Then, in the last column of the attached example template, place the applicable tax code in the lineItemProductTaxCode column (column Q in the attached CSV). Ultimately, the decision to break this out separately or not is up to you (or the Iron Lion Entries team). If the installation charges are not billed independently, they will be considered taxable along with the rest of the transaction. I am attempting to populate the CSV from our filed reports. Does the order of the columns in the CSV matter or must they stay in the represented positions with ""transactionId"" in the first column, etc.? Yes—the order of the columns within the CSV file needs to remain as it is because Zamp's system is designed to import the sales data with the file's columns in the exact order of our template. I hope this helps, and please let us know if you have any questions!"

During our call, we confirmed that the Transaction Sync (bulk/historical) to Zamp is still not functioning, despite clearing the Zamp-related Scheduled Actions and verifying that an order did not have a Zamp Transaction Sync Status of ""Successful"". Here's my Calendly link to schedule a call for next week or after if preferred: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min These are the options for clearing any Zamp Tax-related transaction sync records and effectively ""resetting"" these items: Utilizing the WP-CLI Command via WP-CLI access. This involves creating a file, similar to the attached wp-cli-zamp-reset.php , within the store's theme or a must-use plugin. Run it with the command wp zamp reset-sync . Run the below functions via functions.php - see the attached file. Run the below SQL queries in phpMyAdmin or a similar tool. 2) The functions to run: function reset_zamp_sync_data() {
if (!current_user_can('manage_woocommerce')) {
return 'Insufficient permissions';
}

// Clean up scheduled actions
if (class_exists('ActionScheduler')) {
as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch', array(), 'zamp-transactions-sync');
}

// Clean up options
global $wpdb;
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->options} WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_sync_%'"");
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->options} WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_transactions_queue_%'"");

// Reset sync status
update_option('zamp_sync_status', 'ready');

// Clear transaction status meta
$wpdb->query(""DELETE FROM {$wpdb->postmeta} WHERE meta_key IN ('zamp_transaction_status', 'zamp_transaction_date', 'zamp_transaction_error')"");

return 'Zamp sync data has been completely reset';
}

// Uncomment to run (then comment back after running once)
// add_action('init', function() {
// if (current_user_can('manage_woocommerce') && isset($_GET['reset_zamp_sync'])) {
// echo reset_zamp_sync_data();
// exit;
// }
// }); 3) The SQL queries: -- Clear scheduled actions
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_sync_%';
DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE 'zamp_transactions_queue_%';

-- Reset sync status
INSERT INTO wp_options (option_name, option_value, autoload) 
VALUES ('zamp_sync_status', 'ready', 'yes') 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE option_value = 'ready';

-- Clear transaction status meta
DELETE FROM wp_postmeta 
WHERE meta_key IN ('zamp_transaction_status', 'zamp_transaction_date', 'zamp_transaction_error'); Overall, we're hoping to accomplish the following items somehow: Clean up scheduled actions via Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() Clear any scheduled events with wp_clear_scheduled_hook('zamp_process_transactions_event') Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() - Removes all scheduled batch processing tasks Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data() - Removes all sync progress and queue data from the options table"

After reviewing the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin code looking at zamp-tax/includes/admin/transaction-sync/class-zamp-transaction-sync-batch.php , it appears this could be related to multiple items: The following is similar to situations we worked through at TaxJar for WooCommerce. We may need to involve Arlene Cycle's more technical team for database access, depending on what we find during our call today. Issues After Plugin Reinstallation Several things might cause transactions not to sync to Zamp after reinstallation: Orphaned Action Scheduler Tasks : The plugin uses WooCommerce Action Scheduler to queue batch processing tasks After reinstallation, old scheduled actions might still exist in the database, but the code to handle them might have changed These tasks are stored in the WordPress database in the wp_actionscheduler_actions table Stale Transaction Status Metadata : The plugin stores transaction status as post meta ( zamp_transaction_status ) If an order was previously marked as ""Success"", it won't be reprocessed by default After reinstallation, this metadata remains but the actual sync state might be different Incomplete Cleanup of Previous Sync Data : Batch progress data is stored in WordPress options with prefixes: zamp_transactions_queue_ for batch queues zamp_sync_progress_ for progress tracking If reinstallation happens during an active sync, these might remain in an inconsistent state Sync Status Inconsistency : The global sync status is stored in the zamp_sync_status option If this is stuck in 'in_progress' after reinstallation, new syncs might be blocked Clearing Caches and Resetting Queues To resolve these issues after reinstallation, you should: Clear Action Scheduler Queue : The plugin has a built-in method: Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() This calls as_unschedule_all_actions('zamp_process_transactions_batch', array(), self::SCHEDULER_GROUP) You might need to manually trigger this if the reinstallation didn't properly clean up Clean Up Sync Data : Use Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_sync_data() to remove all sync progress and queue data This removes all options with prefixes zamp_sync_progress_ and zamp_transactions_queue_ Reset Sync Status : Set the sync status back to 'ready': Zamp_Transaction_Sync::set_sync_status('ready') This allows new syncs to be initiated Clear Transaction Status Metadata (if needed): If you want to force reprocessing of previously synced orders, you might need to clear the zamp_transaction_status post meta This would be a custom SQL query against the post meta table The most reliable approach would be to run a cleanup sequence that: Stops any in-progress syncs Clears all scheduled actions Removes all sync-related options Resets the sync status to 'ready' This would give you a clean slate to start syncing transactions again after reinstallation. —————————————————————————————————————————- 1. Zamp Plugin UI The Zamp plugin itself appears to provide some admin UI for transaction sync operations, but based on the code reviewed, there is no explicit UI button or menu for a full ""reset"" or ""cleanup"" of all sync data and scheduled actions. However: Stopping Sync: There is an AJAX action for stopping sync ( zamp_stop_transaction_sync ), which calls Zamp_Transaction_Sync_Batch::cleanup_scheduled_actions() and resets status. If the plugin’s admin UI provides a “Stop Sync” or “Cancel Sync” button, using it will clear scheduled actions and reset the sync status. Starting Sync: Starting a new sync ( zamp_start_transaction_sync ) also calls the cleanup method before creating new batches. So, starting a new sync from the UI should clear out old scheduled actions. No ""Full Reset"" Button: There is no evidence of a UI button to clear all progress, batch queues, or transaction meta in bulk. These are handled in the backend code. 2. WooCommerce Action Scheduler UI WooCommerce (and some plugins) provide an Action Scheduler admin screen at: WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Here, you can view, search, and manually run or delete scheduled actions, including those for Zamp (look for hooks like zamp_process_transactions_batch ). You can manually delete stuck or failed actions from this screen. 3. WordPress Options / Post Meta No UI for Options Table or Post Meta: WordPress does not provide a native UI to delete custom options (like zamp_sync_progress_* , zamp_transactions_queue_* ) or post meta ( zamp_transaction_status ). You would need a plugin like “WP-Optimize”, “Advanced DB Cleaner”, or direct database access for this. 4. Cache Plugins If you are using a caching plugin (e.g., WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache), you can clear the site cache from their UI, but this does not affect Action Scheduler or Zamp sync data. Summary Table What you can do from UI How/Where Stop/cancel sync Zamp plugin admin (if button exists) Start new sync (clears queue) Zamp plugin admin View/delete scheduled actions WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions Clear transaction/post meta Not available in default UI Clear plugin options Not available in default UI Clear site cache Cache plugin UI (not related to Zamp sync) If you need a full reset: Use the Zamp UI to stop any running sync. Use the WooCommerce Scheduled Actions UI to delete any stuck Zamp-related actions. For a true “factory reset” (clearing all progress, queues, and post meta), you would need to run code or SQL, or add a custom admin tool."

Most likely, we need to clear a scheduled action queue or cache, and we might need to investigate any cron jobs. We can dive into that during our call tomorrow!"

In the meantime: 1) Basically nothing happens when I click on Start Sync. 2) I just tried re-running the sync, but nothing happens (as mentioned above). But I do see a new log in the status. Please find attached. Hope this helps - see you tomorrow! Celina"

After reviewing the logs and conducting some research, I don't immediately see the cause of this issue, and we should schedule a call using this link for early next week (if you or the team are available). There are a few items we can review within a WooCommerce order to see what happened and why it didn't sync to Zamp. A call would also be helpful to hunt for details in WooCommerce's 'Scheduled Actions' queue in case something isn't happening there as it should. This is under WooCommerce —> Status —> Scheduled Actions. A few questions: 1) When you have a moment, could you please share a screenshot of what the Zamp Tax WooCommerce plugin shows when attempting to run a historical transaction sync ? I'm curious to see this message and if there's any history, log, or report available to download: However, the Historical Transaction Sync shows ""No sync activity report to load."" 2) If you try rerunning the historical transaction sync, do you see any log files that might be named 'zamp-transactions' or something similar? The logs will be under WooCommerce → Status → Logs and start with 'Zamp.' I'm also working with a colleague who helped build our WooCommerce plugin to sort this out. I'll follow up if there's anything else we need to ask! Have a great weekend!"

Calculations from Zamp aren't returning tax collected, even with Stripe Tax disabled. Notes from the call: Before Zamp, they were using Stripe Tax's plugin for WooCommerce. Taxes calculate fine with Stripe Tax, but they're listed as a different tax line from what Zamp would look for (state + jurisdiction name combination). They're also using WooCommerce Subscriptions. Zamp-specific steps: They had the correct API token for Zamp, but we replaced it and saved anyway. Nexus states are correctly configured in Zamp and Woo. Tax calcs and transaction sync were enabled. Debug mode was enabled today (6/6/25). Disabled Stripe Tax and placed an order with only Zamp Tax enabled, no tax was calculated. Re-enabled Stripe Tax, and the tax was calculated. They have the default PTC enabled. Addresses appear to be formatted fine. No transactions in Zamp are showing tax collected, although tax was collected. Example is TR-1348 shown in the screenshot below. Order ID TR-1348: The transaction sync from 6/3/25: Reviewing the logs: The 6/3/25 log file shows a bunch of 409/conflict errors, meaning the transaction already exists. There are a few subtotal, shipping, and tax errors, where issues with amounts may occur (but only in 5 out of 100+ orders). The 6/5/25 log file shows a bunch of attempts to start tax calculations, but the addresses only contain ""state"":""AZ"" The log files from today ( 6/6/25 ) appear to show successful tax calcs, but no taxes were shown on orders in Zamp, or test checkout orders (not entirely placed): Address for my test: 1395 S Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 85286 There's a 400 bad_request error at 2025-06-06T13:07:39+00:00 due to: Receiving lineItems and quantity as string values instead of numbers (I think?)

An update regarding historical sales data and tax due evaluation: We're still working on a script for the November 2024 through March 2025 sales data that will accurately compare the differences and create offset adjustments (at the transaction or order level) using this Shopify Taxes report with Order IDs.

Q1 2025 is from 3/1/25 to 5/31/25, and is due in June 2025. We share more info about that here , and the NY DOR shares details here . In the Shopify Report here , the total tax collected is $12,616.72 , and Zamp's tax-due estimate is slightly lower (due to time zones, most likely) at $12,606.10 .

I've looked at May's numbers and most look good, WA looks a bit high in zapped, could you help us check here? Sure! The difference in Zamp's tax-due estimate for Washington versus Shopify is caused by the Washington Business & Occupation (B&O) tax , which is a gross receipts tax that businesses pay to the state on gross sales to customers located within Washington. This is a tax that is not typically collected from customers but is required to be paid when filing WA sales tax returns. The Shopify United States Sales Tax Report shows $3,384.16 in tax collected. The breakdown of the B&O tax is: Retailing - Gross Amount: $38,972.09 - Tax Rate: 0.471% - Tax estimated due: $183.56 . Wholesaling - Gross Amount: $9,693.87 - Tax Rate: 0.484% - Tax Due: $46.92 . Combined B&O total : $230.48 The combined total of tax collected and the B&O tax matches Zamp's tax-due estimate ($ 3,609.77 ) within a few dollars (lower): $3,614.64 . Please let us know if you have any questions."

I've attached an XLSX file showing a comparison between Zamp's tax-due estimate and Shopify's United States Sales Tax Reports (links to those reports, below). The Shopify United States Sales Tax Report filtered to New York for the NY Q1 2025 period (3/1/25-5/31/25). The Shopify United States Sales Tax Report here is filtered to only the nexus states we're filing in this month, which are the monthly filing states. The difference here is minimal and is due to a mixture of timely filing discounts and time zones; we share more details in this article . Overall, the Zamp tax-due estimate is lower than Shopify's reporting. In Washington, the difference ( $230.48 ) is due to the state's Business & Occupation Tax , which is a Gross Receipts tax imposed when filing Washington sales tax returns. Please let us know if you have any questions. Have an excellent rest of your week, and I hope that the weekend ahead is relaxing!"

After investigating this further and comparing the May 2025 California transactions against the April 2025 transactions, it appears that sales to customers in CA increased in May 2025. I've attached an export of the transactions in Zamp for CA from May 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025, which is the data used in our tax-due estimate. Does this align with your expectations, or do you have any questions?"

No—Amelia and I were able to find a temporary solution for a tax code that will work for this scenario when utilizing the Zamp API. Amelia will be following up about that shortly! Regarding how to handle this in QuickBooks Online: To my understanding of QuickBooks Online's product and tax settings, it would be best to categorize the product or service item as a Nontaxable item for any of these 3% (or other percentage) fees associated with payment processing. As far as ""non-taxable income"" goes, I believe that would be a separate account (from sales tax) within QuickBooks Online after reading through this resource and this other resource. I'd still recommend that you confirm with QuickBooks Online support to be sure. Regarding using the ""gift card"" code: Yes—that code could be used here as well. Which would be: R_TPP_GIFT-CARD. The thought process on our end regarding the code Amelia will share is that it falls closer to a category that payment processing fees might be categorized under."

Amelia mentioned that it would likely be a case where it is a tpt item and we will have to calculate sales tax based on the full amount that the customer pays; sales price AND surcharge. Would that be the case, then? I'm still wondering how to best handle this for QuickBooks, as I originally thought it would be ""non-taxable income"" for the 3% fee. Sorry for the double message, our website programmer is trying to get the update rolled out asap and wasn't sure if someone else on the support email could jump in."

We're exploring options for this, as I don't believe we currently have a tax code specifically for credit processing fees. I vaguely remember that we've worked with other clients in similar situations, so I'll review what we did in those cases and determine the best path forward. I'll follow up in the most recent email thread, and Amelia looped me in just a bit ago."

2960398615,142112,9030825545,message,2025-06-12T16:21:42Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Allie, You're welcome; thanks for your patience here! what's the best way to ensure this isn't included in the taxable total on Zamp's reports? The likely best path here would be to create a non-taxable item for credit card fees and then confirm via a test invoice that QuickBooks Online does not calculate tax for the item. If we make a non-taxable item for credit card fees, would it effect the total tax owed if other line items in the invoice are taxable? Or will it be avoided if Quickbooks isn't calculating sales tax on it? In this situation, the item's total amount won't be included in the taxable portion of the sales within Zamp, and it won't affect the tax owed, as Zamp files based on the tax collected. That said, the gross sales associated with the transaction would be slightly different in Zamp (grossed down), as we've discussed in the past. The upcoming and improved Zamp QuickBooks Online integration will help resolve scenarios like this, as we'll then receive taxability information from QuickBooks Online at the line item level (if the integration is used and configured). I hope this helps!"

If we implement a 3% upcharge for credit card processing, what's the best way to ensure this isn't included in the taxable total on Zamp's reports? If we make a non-taxable item for credit card fees, would it effect the total tax owed if other line items in the invoice are taxable?

I've connected with Taryn regarding the sales tax calculation situation for Michigan and confirmed that, while Zamp isn't planning to file sales tax returns in Michigan for Accelerated Tooling, the calculations can be handled separately. This would likely simplify the situation and increase accuracy. First, Zamp can provide the tax rates and calculate local sales taxes in Michigan for WooCommerce. Sales tax should also be collected in Minnesota and Texas within WooCommerce. 1) A quick question—would you like us to add MI for calculations within Zamp? The Accelerated Tooling Team will still be able to file MI sales tax returns, as this is a separate process from these calculations. 2) If they aren't enabled already, could you please also enable Minnesota and Texas for calculations within WooCommerce? We share how to enable calculations here , and each nexus state (MI, MN, and TX) would need to be added to the nexus states section: Please let me know if you have any questions, and I'm also happy to schedule a call if that would be helpful."

Questions: 1) Does the above make sense, and is there anything we can help you with here? 2) Are sales tax calculations enabled within WooCommerce? This should be the case as far as we know. We haven't seen any Texas or Minnesota transactions sync to Zamp, yet, so our visibility into this is limited. Please let us know if you have any questions! We're also happy to discuss this further during a call ."

Kyle: When you have a moment to review, I realized that at least part of the issue with the data importing was related to incorrect addresses, specifically those with the ' attn ' or someone's name in the shipToAddress1 column. I've attached the original file with the California-only data and the file that we imported into Zamp, as an example for comparison. The addresses with portions of the address removed and highlighted (in the 2nd file) are the transactions with suspected incorrectness. This is only part of the situation here, but I wanted to bring it up as you were asking about any issues with the data. I hope that you have a wonderful week!"

When Kyle and I spoke last week, we discussed that some transactions were missing, which was the primary cause of the difference between the CA and FL filed amounts vs the provided file. We've implemented process improvements to prevent this in the future and also raised this with our engineering team. A quick question: Anita, do we have your approval to include these missing transactions in the June 2025 filing period and return? Or do you have a different preference? I've attached the files that show the missing transactions. I will help ensure these are accounted for and provide extra review of the June 2025 data, once it's supplied and imported. Please let me know if you have any questions!"

Explained the situation, and Kyle understood. Escalate to eng. Other notes and details: They've conducted extensive testing for July 1st with Zamp and are using Zamp for the filings. They might switch to Zamp calculations. Using the TaxJar API is inexpensive, and we want to avoid the technical work. They discovered that Alaska doesn't return the FreightTaxable flags in TaxJar. In Alaska, some municipalities calculate tax on shipping, while others do not, depending on the locality. Do you know if Zamp has already gotten this right? If so, they might move over. It's not a huge cost savings, but it would be good to have better accuracy. A feature request: Is there a way to look up a tax rate without a total? Just an address. If the address validation includes fields such as tax rate, freight taxable, etc., this could be useful. He's happy to hop on with product and engineering folks to hear their reasoning and why, etc. This is tied to how their ERP works; it stores a tax jurisdiction with a rate for the ship-to location, and they can't tie it to an order."

We've adjusted for the voided invoices by deleting them, as Zamp's Nexus Analysis does not include refunds in its analysis. This is based on our Tax Research Team's recent research, which confirmed transaction types considered in economic nexus thresholds. Zamp typically doesn't have a concept of voided invoices except to create a refund transaction. This way, those won't count towards economic nexus thresholds. We'll follow up with you in the July 2nd email thread to confirm the necessary adjustments have been made for the filings due this month and separately send a tax-due estimate.

I've confirmed that we can now access RecRe's QuickBooks Online account, and your note about the invoice's 'Amount' being '0' is helpful. I also noticed a 'Memo/Description' that notes'Voided'. We'll work with this data, and I've also created a separate Zamp Sales Tax Report that displays these details. We can use this to identify voided transactions and ensure that Credit Memos are captured. Once we've discussed the impact of voided invoices, we'll follow up with a path forward or a call to discuss it further."

Also, in reference to your question about the voided transactions, these are preliminary invoices for bids and possible contract renewals. They may not actually be paid. That's why we void them. If we get the contract or renewal, then we will produce the final invoice which is submitted for payment. Does that make more sense? When I void it, the invoice reverts to $0 and should not be counted towards sales tax reporting. Best, Mary Beth"

Correct—Zamp does not yet have an App available within QuickBooks Online, but that is an item in progress at the time, and we hope to have it available soon (we're currently going through a review process with Intuit). This upcoming and improved integration will include support for voided invoices. Our existing QuickBooks Online integration does not support accounting for voided invoices. If you'd prefer not to set Zamp up as an accounant within QuickBooks Online, would you prefer that we send a CSV reminder email to provide us with a list of the voided invoices and their transaction details? If so, we share how to format a CSV utilizing the attached template in our article here ."

The good news is that we can help resolve this voided invoice situation. I've added an item on our end that will help with this in the future as a reminder to our team (Technical Success) and each month before we file. A few questions: 1) When you have a moment (it can be next week, of course), could you please add Zamp ( integrations@zamp.com ) as an accounant user within your QuickBooks Online account? 2) Would you like us to delete any of these invoices from your Zamp Transactions, or would you prefer that we zero them out? This is a path we should consider for transactions in non-nexus states, as Zamp's Economic Nexus logic will disregard refund transactions, since no US states currently include refunds in their Economic Nexus thresholds. Alternatively, I'd be more than happy to talk with you over a call if you'd like to schedule one instead."

I am working on Financials and am confused about the estimated tax payment made for April to California. The invoices you pulled from Quickbook were based on his invoices in April, not the payments received from customers for the sales tax collected. I show in April, over $9k in sales tax money was collected in payments. You paid significantly less. When I looked up the invoices numbers you referenced, these invoices were billed in April but not necessarily paid yet. Why weren't the taxes Chuck received in payments paid out for the estimated tax? I am attaching the report I have showing what taxes were collected by Forcible Entry in April. Please advise as they are a cash basis company and I think those tax amounts collected should have been remitted. Thank you, Renee"

That said, I had a quick question about our BigCommerce access: Can you add the permissions noted below to the Zamp user ( filing@zamp.com ) within your BigCommerce store? I did not mention this permission to Taryn when we were discussing the situation; I'll be more careful in the future. Depending on how your BigCommerce store is configured (or the subscription, possibly), it appears that these should be the permissions we'll need based on what BigCommerce notes in this article : Export Orders Manage Export Templates There's a slight chance we'll need the ' Manage Orders ' permission, which we'd recommend removing after we gather the necessary order data. We require this permission to export BigCommerce sales data and ensure it's included in the filings, but we don't appear to have the necessary permissions.

Regarding Order ID 229610: This makes sense! Yes, we're now seeing this transaction updated within Zamp: The updated tax-due estimate for Florida: The amount has been updated to $478.94 , which accounts for a Florida timely filing discount (also known as the Florida ' Collection Allowance ') of $12.28 . The total tax collected that we see is $491.22 , which aligns with the combined sum of the tax due, as noted in bold, and the timely filing discount. Here's an updated table with the FL amount updated: State code Period Estimated sales tax FL May 2025 $478.94 GA May 2025 $197.14 IL May 2025 $254.00 MI May 2025 $35.82 MN May 2025 $119.00 OH May 2025 $297.99 UT May 2025 $294.65 VA May 2025 $177.40 Estimated sales tax this month: May 2025 $1,854.94 Please let me know if we have your approval to proceed with the FL filing or if you have any questions."
2956910772,140400,9019804104,customer,2025-06-09T19:10:02Z,ken@wiredwatts.com,I will take a look to see how I am sending you dates. My assumption is we are sending them without the timezone.. I will have to figure that one out. I'm not worried about it since the taxes are paid and it's settled. The other one does have a tax free exemption because it's a church. I updated it with the API on our end. Please run the Florida report one more time and let me see if it coincides with what I have on my end.

2956910772,140400,9019680399,message,2025-06-09T18:50:46Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Ken, Thanks for the response; continued patience here! So, it should not be run in EST, it should be run in EDT should it not? Correct! In this situation, a time zone-related difference would be a bit different because of the following: Zamp's API receives date stamps (the transactionDate property) in UTC unless the time zone is specified in the request. I can confirm if this is the case if you or your team could share an example API request with me. Zamp then converts the UTC date/time stamp into EST for Florida. The above means that there can still be a slight variance depending on whether the date/time stamp sent to Zamp was in UTC or if it indicated the time zone was in EST. Here's how to indicate if a date/time stamp is in UTC or EST: For UTC, the date/time value would have a 'Z' at the end like this: 2025-06-09T18:40:00 Z For EST, the date/time value would have a time zone on the end of it, such as '-4:00' for EST (EDT, during Daylight Saving Time), such as: 2025-06-09T18:40:00 -04:00 That said, I don't believe time zones are the cause of the larger difference you've noted for Florida here, and I'll share more details below. The cause of the Florida discrepancy here: After digging into this further, I found that the cause of the difference was related to Order ID 229610 because this transaction was created within Zamp as if it should be fully taxable, and $0 tax was collected: For API integrations such as Wired Watts' integration with Zamp, our tax-due estimates are based on what should have been collected via the Zamp API (the taxDue amount). A few questions: 1) Should this transaction be treated as RESALE (wholesale) or something other than fully taxable? 2) If so, does Wired Watts have the ability to update the transaction via the API? We can sort out a path forward for adjusting to this situation once we have more details. I'm also happy to hop on a call with you if that would be helpful! Please let us know if you have any questions."
2956910772,140400,9019650433,note,2025-06-09T18:35:50Z,chris@zamp.com,"Research: I don't see any negative jurisdictions in FL , so that's not the cause. Time zones don't account for this either, because when adjusting for UTC, there is only one extra transaction worth a few dollars in sales tax. This issue appears to be related to Order ID 229610, as it has $0 tax collected but a taxDue, which is likely due to the API. https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/3319-variance-reviewing-by-transactiontax-table?companyId=cm3j4a2ee01c1jx82bksg33hq&stateCode=FL&startDate=2025-05-01&endDate=2025-05-31"
2956910772,140400,9002581032,customer,2025-06-03T20:47:39Z,ken@wiredwatts.com,"I understand the idea of the time zone thing if the state was in a separate time zone from us, however, that part of Florida is in the same time zone as us in GA. We are both in the Eastern time zone and practice daylight savings at the same time. We recorded the transaction to take place on 5/1/2024 at 12:40 am as did you. If the transaction came in at that time, it was May 1st when that person placed their order in that city in the United States. The only discrepancy would be daylight savings… which the United States takes part in. So, it should not be run in EST, it should be run in EDT should it not? Either way, it sounds like it was already paid for, and as you said, the ~$2 is not the issue here. However, I would like to hear your thoughts on this because this does not make our books align with whatever you are doing on your end. As for the major discrepancy, please let me know what you find. As stated earlier, you can take this email as a ""Go-Ahead"" on the rest of the filings, we don't need to delay that any further. Just hold off on Florida until we can get some clarity.

Regarding Transaction ID 841408 , Zamp is placing this transaction within the April 2025 filing period for Florida. This happens because Zamp files in each state based on the state capital's time zone . Because Florida is in the Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone and this transaction had a UTC timestamp of May 1, 2025, at 12:40 AM, it is included in the April 2025 filing. This transaction can be viewed on your Transactions page here . This transaction doesn't explain the full difference here, though. There are a few other items this could be related to, but we'll need to confirm. We'll investigate further and follow up as soon as we can."

We investigated this further and confirmed that the difference noted between 'Taxes Due' and 'Tax Collected' is related to the timely filing discounts and the Washington Business and Occupation (B&O) tax. There is some difference here due to sales tax rounding as well. The timely filing discounts can be reviewed on each state's sales tax filing (return) artifact available on your Zamp account's Filing Page here . The discounts vary in name but apply to each state with differences greater than approximately $1.00. In the future, we hope to display the timely filing discount in an easy-to-access way, and we've already started discussions with our engineering team about this. Have a great week!"

I'd also like to note that we need to hear back about this, have the situation sorted out, and receive approval to file your sales tax returns by the end of the day on Monday (6/16/25) to ensure the filings are processed on time for NY and CA."
2956898553,140303,9033866034,message,2025-06-13T14:12:03Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Richard, Thanks for your continued patience here! We've confirmed that the tax-due estimate Zamp shared is based on the tax collected from your Shopify store, which includes both in-person POS location sales and online sales. To our understanding, if a business has nexus in a state, sales tax is calculated and collected for in-person locations and online sales. Additionally, Zamp's tax-due estimate includes only the taxes we've seen collected within your Shopify store. I've attached an export of the transactions we've sold to or shipped to customers located in California and New York. It's important to note that the New York filing includes transactions from March 1, 2025, to May 31, 2025, because New York follows a fiscal quarter with a different date range than other states. A couple of quick questions: 1) To review this further and compare directly against Shopify's reporting, could you please share your Shopify store's Collaborator request code ? This code should be under Settings —> Users within your Shopify Admin. The collaborator access code is something separate from Zamp's automatic import of your Shopify transactions and allows us to review orders, sales tax reporting, and tax settings. 2) Also, could you let me know if we have your approval to proceed with After Market's filings this month? We've held the filings to allow time to investigate this and ensure we're all on the same page."

Yes—if this is completed over the weekend, that will give us enough time to get the data into Zamp, for Zamp's system to calculate the estimated tax due, and for us to get an estimate out to you. That said, we would need to have the filings approved and released by the end of the day on Monday. If that would be a stretch or tight turnaround on your end, we can push them into June 2025 to then proceed with $0 filings (with the goal being to file timely, avoid going to the overdue filings queue, and avoid penalties & interest from the state.) What would you say works best for you?"

Just so you know, Shopify Tax is handling the sales tax calculations here, as Zamp is unable to calculate sales tax within Shopify. Zamp will, however, provide the economic nexus threshold monitoring, registration, filing, and compliance aspects of the puzzle."

The sandbox was connected yesterday, and I disconnected the live/production Zamp account from Shopify as well. I've also deleted all transactions within the production Zamp account.

I don't seem to be able to add members, please could you add Angus to the Zamp portal? Sure! I've added Angus as a user to the Ancient + Brave Zamp portal, and an invite was sent to angus@ancientandbrave.earth . If we should add Tom or others to the Ancient + Brave Zamp portal, please let us know either in this email thread or onboarding@zamp.com. Chris - should all wholesale transactions show as RESALE in Zamp, regardless of nexus/non-nexus/certificate exemption status? Yes—all wholesale transactions will show up as RESALE within Zamp, and we'd recommend implementing a process around this regardless of nexus/non-nexus considerations. The reason for the above is that some US states exclude Wholesale/Resale transactions from their economic nexus thresholds, and Zamp has logic in place to account for this, state by state. In terms of letting you know test orders to delete from Zamp, is there a deadline to communicate this to you before they get filed? Yes—we would need to know which transactions to delete (a date range or IDs/names) by the 5th of the month if Zamp is filing sales tax returns for Ancient + Brave, as that is typically the earliest date we would start filing. Can we also see US sales tax in the order in Shopify? Yes—once tax collection is enabled for a state within Shopify, the tax will show up as a line between Subtotal and Total on a Shopify order: Here's an example: I assume I can go ahead and set Ohio up as a state A+B collects tax in on Shopify safely before I go on holiday? Sure, if that works best for you! I'll need to do this before UAT starts, but it makes me nervous that we're using Zamp's live system to test on the test Shopify store - is there not a sandbox we can connect to? I understand, and we can certainly switch to using a Sandbox account here instead. I've created an account within Zamp titled ""Ancient + Brave Sandbox,"" and I've invited the following emails as users to this account. hello@emmaforward.co.uk angus@ancientandbrave.earth sophie@highcohesion.com A question here —since we're taking the sandbox approach with this, is it OK if we temporarily disconnect the Shopify store (ancientandbrave-us.myshopify.com) from the production account, named ""Ancient + Brave""? I could then also remove any test transactions that have synced so far."

Angus, is it helpful to add Tom too if he'll be supporting on UAT as well? Chris - should all wholesale transactions show as RESALE in Zamp, regardless of nexus/non-nexus/certificate exemption status? I want to be crystal clear on the UAT sheet's expected results. In terms of letting you know test orders to delete from Zamp, is there a deadline to communicate this to you before they get filed? Additionally, in the expected results on the UAT sheet, I've said to check Zamp for US sales tax calcs. Can we also see US sales tax in the order in Shopify? I don't see it as a line item in there currently when I look at a test order in Shopify, but we haven't set up Ohio as nexus yet.

Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team, and I'm jumping in to help after syncing with Caroline about your questions. Also, I'm in the process of writing the testing scripts for the Shopify integration. Are there any particular testing scenarios you think are worth including? We'd recommend testing some basic scenarios here, and other testing depends on the third-party Shopify apps that are planned for implementation: An order shipping to a nexus state (e.g., Ohio) has tax collected. An order to a non-nexus state (not set up to collect tax) does not have tax collected. Orders for wholesale customers do not have tax collected and show up within Zamp as RESALE on the transactions page. If any third-party apps, such as those listed below, are used, we recommend reviewing those orders to ensure the tax amounts match within Zamp and Shopify (we can help if this is not the case or if these apps are planned). Loop - returns & exchanges. ReturnGo AfterShip Outside of the above, everything should be smooth sailing. I reviewed the Ancient + Brave store and confirmed that products are categorized and Shopify Tax is enabled. Also, once you know that your testing is complete, please let us know, and we can remove the test orders from Zamp by either the Shopify Order ID, Order Name, or a date range.

2945627338,136371,9052349075,note,2025-06-19T18:23:39Z,chris@zamp.com,"@carie - I've been working through the output Kyle shared. A few things: I realized we needed data from 11/1/23 to 12/31/24; we didn't need the October 2023 data, as we didn't file (per Nicole's notes above). The SUM of tax still doesn't match the tax due in the liability report , but that may be fine. I realized that we don't have the source data they're comparing against, so it's challenging to determine how close we are or whether this is the right approach to take. There are some transactions (highlighted in green in the attached file) that were created or updated after we filed for the customer. Although the amount is small, it may make a difference. I didn't see many transactions that had a difference between the Zamp created date and the updated date, meaning it's unlikely there were many updates to the data after we filed. There was one transaction, but it was updated 1 minute after it was created, and that shouldn't matter. This won't account for edited orders or partial refunds in Shopify (as Kyle noted here .) Could the customer be granted an extension, or should we schedule a call to talk about this more? They keep asking for the BigCommerce transactions or source files, but those will not match; we might want to explain that. I'd need more time to review the numbers and the data they're comparing against (we don't have all Nov 2023-Dec 2024 filing amounts uploaded into Zamp, it appears ). cc: @nick @ashleyD - in case either of you has thoughts or ideas.

The following questions are: Is it best to use taxable and nontaxable amounts, or should the taxable amount be included in the transaction subtotal? What's the best way to have a single row per transaction with the above amounts and tax amounts? (Likely a bit of quick work in Excel to sum it by row.)

We understand that process changes take time, and we appreciate your patience as we work through these scenarios. Sometimes, (like this month or last month), we can accurately sort through it later in the month than we'd like. We still have some outstanding items surrounding wholesale transactions and order edit review in historical periods that we're working through (it's taken much longer than expected due to the volume of data and unexpected delays on our end). OK, understood regarding wholesale transactions. Please let us know if the scenarios arise where tax is refunded or if you have any questions. You're very welcome!

I've shared this with our team. The tax per state looks good to me and I've already approved it for payments. I also really appreciate the effort you're putting in to make sure everything reconciles correctly - it's important we're only paying taxes we're actually responsible for. Regarding Wholesale transactions : What typically happens on our end is that the customer reaches out letting us know tax was incorrectly applied, and we either have to reimburse them or they short pay the invoice, which then requires us to manually correct the order. Going forward, we'll tighten this up to ensure anything tagged as WholesaleNoTax is properly exempted and doesn't have tax collected. Appreciate your help on all of this - let me know if anything else is needed from our side. Best, Andy"

I've confirmed that after running our temporary workaround method to force the reconciliation between Zamp's tax amounts and Shopify's tax amounts, the estimate sent just a bit ago aligns with the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report for April 2025 when filtering by Shopify Destination states we're filing in this month; I've attached a copy of that export from Shopify. Regarding Wholesale transactions: I've also attached a comparison of a Shopify export (looking for the 'Wholesale' or 'WholesaleNoTax' tags), which shows several transactions tagged with a wholesale tax, that have tax collected and paid without tax refunds. There are about 10 transactions with either of these tags that haven't been paid yet (it looks like they have various payment terms), and one example is #490783 . For the transactions noted above with payment pending and a wholesale tag, will the tax be removed from those Shopify orders, and should we offset this within Zamp? Please let me know if you'd like to hop on a quick call to discuss."

The estimate was generated after I adjusted for order edits; the work file is attached. There is a difference here due to sales tax rounding in various states, and some due to refunds causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions. The difference/variance is small percentage-wise. Time zone differences are no longer a factor here as this export adjusts for that; this is also possible within the Zamp portal. I've also sent Bobbi an invite to the Zamp portal as our multi-user login feature was released and I missed doing this, previously. I've also attached an export of all transactions within Zamp."

To our understanding (and Stripe's), the products (subscription) would be fully taxable in Texas, and the 80% alternate rate wouldn't apply here. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed is up to you, but I wanted to ensure we're on the same page. This was noted on 5/12: On the surface, the Texas sales tax calculation piece is correct to our knowledge for Software as a Service (SaaS), and we'll confirm CT's tax rate for this product type. As soon as we've confirmed these details or have more information to share, we'll follow up immediately. If you wish to categorize your product as Software as a Service (SaaS) within Stripe, that would achieve the goal of charging 80% of the full rate in TX with these codes: txcd_10103000 - Software as a service (SaaS) - personal use txcd_10103001 - Software as a service (SaaS) - business use Zamp's filing service would support the 80% alternate rate if Stripe is categorized with one of the codes noted above. Please let us know if you have any questions."

I’m following up on the tax treatment of your Substack newsletter as a digital good in Texas and Connecticut, as our Tax Research Team shared some additional context and discovered an item specific to Connecticut. In Texas , a Substack newsletter is classified as a digital good, treated as tangible personal property under Texas Tax Code § 151.009 . This means it is subject to the full sales tax rate, similar to physical goods, and not at the reduced 80% taxable threshold that applies to certain services like information or data processing services ( Texas Tax Code § 151.351 ). Substack's digital newsletter is a product, not a service. Specifically, downloadable articles (txcd_10303000) and non-downloadable articles ( txcd_10304102 ) are taxable sales in Texas. In Connecticut , digital goods are also considered tangible personal property and are generally subject to the standard 6.35% sales tax rate, as outlined in Special Notice 2018(8) . However, after further review, Connecticut exempts sales of newspapers, whether in physical or electronic form, from sales tax under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-412(114) . As a result, both downloadable ( txcd_10303000 ) and non-downloadable ( txcd_10304102 ) newsletter articles are exempt from sales tax in Connecticut. It’s worth noting that some platforms, like Stripe, may not distinguish between electronically supplied goods or services in their general categories, such as the Stripe Tax code txcd_10000000 , which is currently configured. This means that if the path to not distinguish between downloadable and non-downloadable is taken, Stripe and Zamp would treat Citrinitas' newsletter product as taxable in both CT and TX. I hope this is helpful, and please let us know if you have any questions."

2936435078,132883,8955947371,note,2025-05-21T16:19:06Z,chris@zamp.com,"From Tax Research (Mira) here: https://linear.app/zamptax/issue/TBD-349/request-confirmation-on-ptc-taxability-for-substack-in-texas-and 1.  Should a Substack newsletter be considered a digital good within Texas and Connecticut's definitions? Yes, an online newsletter is a digital good within both states, but the taxation varies (see below). 2.  Are digital goods in Texas fully taxable or taxed at a reduced rate or threshold of 80%, like SaaS is? Digital goods in Texas are taxed like tangible personal property. TX Letter Ruling 20005359L indicates that digital products are tangible personal property as defined in TX Tax Code § 151.009 (""'Tangible personal property' means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched or that is perceptible to the senses in any other manner, and, for the purposes of this chapter, the term includes a computer program and a telephone prepaid calling card.""). The 80% tax situation applies only to information services and data processing services ( TX Tax Code § 151.351 ). ""Information service"" is defined as ""furnishing general or specialized news or other current information"" unless it is furnished to a physical, printed newspaper licensed by the Federal Communications Commission ( TX Tax Code § 151.0038(1) ). Substack's digital newsletter is a product, ​not a service​. The service of providing information to a newspaper is different from the digital newspaper/newsletter that is produced and distributed. As long as Substack categorizes its product as a digital newsletter (rather than some sort of service), it has to treat it as a digital good. Therefore, in Texas, R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS for downloadable articles and R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS_NEWSPAPER for non-downloaded articles are both taxable sales (which we have correct in our system). 3 - Would a digital good be considered fully taxable in CT or taxed at a 1% rate? Special Notice 2018(8) indicates that digital goods are included in the definition of tangible personal property and are taxed at the 6.35% rate effective Oct. 2019. However, sales of newspapers, whether sold as physical copies or electronically accessed or transferred are exempt from sales tax ( Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-412(114) ). Therefore, in Connecticut, R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS for downloadable articles and R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS_PERIODICALS_NEWSPAPER for non-downloaded articles are both exempt sales (which we have correct in our system). I also want to point out that Stripe does not distinguish between an electronically supplied good or service at the ""general"" category that appears on Substack's support article . But for tax purposes, it is a vital distinction. It's up to the customer to classify their product correctly. In my opinion, a newsletter is a digital good, not a service. Let me know if I can be of further help!"

I've imported the credit memo, and that change is now reflected in our tax-due estimate. Regarding #2 —yes, that's correct! These would be related to any credit memos not sourced from Shopify and are processed within QuickBooks Online. Below is the updated tax-due estimate, but first, I wanted to share some details about the difference for Colorado. Regarding Colorado: The $42.60 difference for Colorado is related to a refund transaction (#1899), causing the tax amount for the Denver, CO local jurisdictions within the CO filing to become negative. This applies to the City, County, and special tax (e.g., transportation or facilities-related districts). God's True Cashmere didn't have enough sales in these jurisdictions throughout April 2025 to cover the full refunded tax amount. A portion of the refunded tax is excluded from the filing because the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) doesn't allow negative amounts in local jurisdictions when filing Colorado returns; the majority of states don't allow this. In a situation like this, Zamp would need to file the sales tax return in CO as it is or after removing the refund transaction. As an exception, we can move this refund transaction into the May 2025 filing period to be processed in June 2025 if you'd like us to. Please note that we'll need to know how to proceed here by the end of the day (EST) tomorrow, May 15th, 2025 , to file for God's True Cashmere in a timely manner. If we cannot proceed or don't hear back, the filings will need to move into our overdue filings queue and could be subject to state-applied penalties & interest.

We're investigating this and hope to have more details to share by tomorrow morning. A few questions: 1) To confirm, is the Credit Memo #4385_je associated with invoice AM 4001 from December 2024? We're preparing to manually import this credit memo because our current QuickBooks Online integration does not currently support syncing Credit Memos. 2) Can we reach out at the beginning of each month, before filings start, to see if there are any Credit Memos we should import from QBO? I'm also rebuilding some items within our tax-due estimate for Colorado and will continue to investigate that item."

I'm part of the Technical Success Team here at Zamp, and we've been investigating the differences noted for the November 2025 filing period. After further review, it appears that Shopify Tax collected amounts for the October 2024 filing period (10/1/24-10/31/24) were used for the comparison on the 'Zamp-Filings' sheet of the file you shared. I've attached a modified version of your XLSX file with an extra sheet showing the November 2024 Shopify tax collected amounts on their own; this is on the 'Z Shopify Review - Nov 24' sheet. The 'Zamp-Filings' sheet has been updated with those amounts. That said, we're still seeing close to a 12% difference between Zamp and Shopify for Oklahoma and Rhode Island ; those are highlighted in blue. In both of these states, Zamp filed overdue returns in January 2025, while they were due in December 2024. The differences here are due to penalties & interest assessed by the state. The differences that are under or within ~2% are very likely due to timely filing discounts, rounding, or time zone differences; we share more info about that here . We also reviewed your account for known third-party apps (such as Loop, which Zamp accounts for and appears to be appropriately configured) or edge-case scenarios that might cause differences. A quick question: Which Shopify Report do you use to reconcile and compare? In our Comparison, we used the Shopify United States Sales Tax Report because Velvet Caviar uses Shopify Tax for the calculations. We've found this report to typically align closely with Zamp (with a few differences noted above). It also appears that you're likely using this report, but we wanted to confirm. If you'd like to discuss this on a call next week or sometime soon, please use this link to schedule a call . Have a wonderful weekend!"

When registering in California, the state flagged the original nexus start date as potentially being after the point of crossing the economic threshold and they wanted Velvet Caviar to reassess this information. After further conversation with Paul, the nexus start date was reassessed to March 1, 2023. This was resolved in February after the Q4 2024 deadline resulting in penalties and interest associated with the filing. This is the difference you are seeing for this period. We are reviewing these periods and will keep you updated. Thank you! In New York, you are on a quarterly prepayment filing frequency so the majority of the tax had already been submitted as ""Advance payments"". You can find this on your New York Q4 2024 return on page 8. I hope that this helps to clarify and please let me know if you have any further questions! In the meantime, we will work to look closer at November. Best, Ashley"

I also took another pass at reconciling the Shopify sales report. I understand there may be some timing differences, but I wanted to flag a few discrepancies and get your input: California Q4 shows a large discrepancy 129K paid vs 115K on the report-do you have any insight into this? November filings across multiple states also seem off. Was there a specific issue that month that could be contributing to these variances? Could it also be tied to the California Q4 discrepancy? Just a heads up: the Shopify report I'm using includes returns in the tax totals. Lastly, regarding New York : it looks like we began filing monthly starting in December, but the Q4 NY filing totals only show about $11K-did we potentially miss a month? Let me know what you think when you get a chance and if it would be easier to just jump on a call. Thanks -- Israel Vaca Financial Controller | Velvet Caviar inc. VelvetCaviar.com | @velvetcaviar"

I missed including the Shopify United States sales tax report tax amounts in my previous email. When filtering that report by the states listed in the tax-due estimate, Zamp's estimate is within $41.86 of Shopify's total tax amount ($6,321.79). This difference is due to the timely filing discounts we automatically account for in the states noted below and time zone adjustments.

We've started investigating this and haven't yet found the exact (or entire) root cause. We've discovered eighteen 2024 exchange transactions processed through Loop that could be a part of the difference you're seeing. We'll also dig deeper into Loop return transactions. In the past, these transactions have been processed correctly with Zamp because our Shopify integration has some Loop-specific logic in place for handling those. When you have a moment, could you please share a copy or export of whichever report you're using to determine this potential variance? This will help us remain on the same page and compare similar data sets. We'll find the pattern and root cause one way or another! We hope to have more details to share by early next week!"

So far, I see very few Loop transactions that overstate the tax due because we see Loop exchange transactions without tax listed (which would mean they probably have the Loop Discount disabled, which is what we want). https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2sou8001uto8m6dh2m8ykj/transactions?search=EXC&date=2025-01-01%7E2025-05-08&limit=100 That said, there are ~15-18 transactions since we started filing (8/1/23-5/8/25) where Loop transactions associated with exchanges have tax associated with them; these would typically cause duplicate tax. We'll need to dig into this further, but these can also be adjusted for within future periods. https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/5644-find-shopify-loop-exchange-transactions-with-tax-collected-v2?company=clv2sou8001uto8m6dh2m8ykj&start=2023-08-01&end=2025-05-08 We'll also need to manually review their Shopify transactions vs. Zamp transactions because they're using Avalara for tax calculations in Shopify , which is trickier to investigate. (We don't have the Shopify US Taxes report to work off of, just the 'taxes' report , which I'll need to review more.) That said, Zamp's estimate is under the total tax collected for April 2025 in the 'Taxes Report', but that's likely due to filing frequency differences and time zones."

Our engineering team recently completed the data removal request, and we've imported the QuickBooks Online data manually. I've attached an XLSX file showing the invoices and credit memos we exported from QuickBooks Online, with rows for invoices missing addresses highlighted. The rows highlighted in blue are invoices missing addresses within the March 2025 and April 2025 filing periods. Invoices before March 2025 are highlighted green if they're missing addresses. We'd love to have the addresses for these as soon as possible (ideally today) so that we can proceed with your filings. Alternatively, those invoices could be included in a future filing period. We should have an updated tax-due estimate heading your way within the next hour . For Zamp to file on time, we would ideally move forward with your approval to file by the end of the day today , which is a tight turnaround time. If you have questions or would like to, we can also hop on a quick call. I'm available from 2:30 to 4:00 PM EST today and can send out a calendar invite if that time works as well (it won't show on my calendar link). I'm happy to help with questions via email, too!"

We'd need to use: The United States sales tax report and the Transactions version of that report. I'd usually run the Shopify forced recon script here, and we still could, but I did that already for this customer before filing. We'd likely want to look at the results of Variance reviewing and j urisdiction-level queries to see if anything stands out. Suppose they have a bunch of refunds in various states, making the amount in the jurisdiction-level query negative. If the amount is negative and ends up being close to the difference here, that is likely the culprit. There's a good chance the differences are just time zones, rounding, etc, as the overall difference is only ~6.6%, but it's high in some states. Lucas or I are happy to help with this too, if there are questions."

For Invoice 5894, I believe what is happening here is related to some updates we made to our QuickBooks Online export processing script that are likely improperly processing the street address (the way QuickBooks Online formats/stores their addresses can make some of this tricky). We use the zip code to determine the state a transaction belongs in, but for some reason, it's using the full address. We'll revert our script updates or find a way around this situation. We'll sort this out today, review all other transactions, and likely re-import the data to ensure accuracy."

We have properly adjusted the amounts using the exchange rate provided in QuickBooks Online and dividing the 'Amount' and 'Tax Amount' values by that rate. For transactions where the invoice was in CAD but billed to a US address, we used an exchange rate of 1.34. I've attached a file showing the work (this Zamp Sales Tax QBO Report) around the exchange rate math and the file we imported into Zamp. I've also attached a file showing the current transactions in Zamp because we still see over $100k in sales to PA from 5/1/24 to 4/30/25, one of the periods used to evaluate PA economic nexus thresholds. This is using a mix of data from Stripe and QBO. A few questions: 1) Do you know if the files look right to you regarding the amounts? 2) Do you know if the PA Transactions still match your expectations?"

But I think I found the issue 😊 What I believe is happening is that things are importing with a translation issue. If we're using the foreign currency, then the integration is multiplying by the currency conversion rate instead of what we should be doing, which is dividing. As an example, Invoice 6448 should total $18,000 USD but is showing up as ~$36,800 USD in Zamp (see attached screenshots). If I take the QBO canadian amount of $25,734.33 CAD, and divide it by $18,000 USD, that implies a 1.429685 exchange rate. But $25,734.33 * 1.429685 = $36,791.99 which is what is showing up in Zamp. Let me know what you think or if you would like to chat through! Cheers, Bill"

We're still evaluating the situation and data from multiple angles. We've had a few unexpected delays. So far, we haven't found evidence of transactions sold through Marketplace Platforms having tax attributed to them within Zamp because Zamp will attribute a $0 transaction tax value for Meta, Shop, and TikTok if our integration ""knows"" that the transaction is from one of those channels. By extension, this should mean that the Taxes Collected Report shouldn't include Marketplace Facilitator tax collection. This situation is tricky because, to my understanding, not all SHOP transactions will be associated with Marketplace Facilitator tax collection. That said, I'd like to be sure we're on the same page and have a couple of quick questions: Note—I will also sync with Ashley about this when we're all back from the US holiday this weekend. 1) Which Marketplace or Shop Channel transactions do you see tax collection for, within Zamp? 2) If a specific transaction wasn't the cause of the concern, was this related to differing amounts in the liability review process? 3) To ensure we're comparing and reviewing the same data sources, could you please let us know which Shopify Reports were used in this liability review and reconciliation process? Was it the United States Sales Tax Report , the Taxes Report , or something else? Have a wonderful weekend!"

As I mentioned, the main goal is to be able to support the liability on our B/S. Currently the only two reports available are the 1) Taxes Collected report and the 2) Tax Liability report. The tax collected report includes taxes collected on marketplace platforms so this report overstates our liability. While the tax liability provides a fairly accurate tax liability for states that are reported monthly, however the tax liability report does not provide the tax liability for states with a quarterly, semi-annual or annual reporting requirement like Illinois which has an annual reporting. Any help on providing a report that would support our tax liability would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Sandy Jones Iron Clad Consulting Controller"

In our analysis, we have found transactions that are not being remitted as they should.  I'd like to set up some time to understand why Zamp is not reporting and sending sales tax on the following Shop Channel Transactions and what needs to be done to correct this.  I could not find a way within Zamp to set up a time to discuss these issues so I am reaching out via email. Following are the general areas that I would like to discuss with you: Shopify Payments - the majority of the transactions are flowing through to Zamp with a few exceptions.  For example, transaction ID 6005407449255 - Shopify shows $2.56 in sales tax collected but Zamp did not report these taxes. TikTok - This looks like an integration we may need to add as no TikTok transactions are being reported.  How do we go about getting this Channel added in Zamp? Shop Cash / Shopify Payments - when a customer uses Shop Cash, Zamp is not remitting the sales tax - Is this a separate integration?  Why would this be?  For example, transaction ID 6005255405735 - Shopify shows $6.24 in sales tax collected but Zamp did not report these taxes. How are returns handled?  Do they just flow into the next month's reporting? How do we go about getting the previous month's sales tax reported/sent to the proper governmental authorities? I have copied Sam Bauman, David Protein's Director of Finance, if you need any authorization to speak to me on his account.  Please suggest a few times when we could discuss the above or send me a link to select a time to meet. Thanks, Sandy Jones Iron Clad Consulting Controller (928) 261-0357"

We're working through some data items for the month, including Barton's eBay transaction import. Once we've imported the eBay data, we'll send out the monthly filing email to ensure marketplace (or any) transactions are included in the filing. For April 2025, Barton shouldn't have any filings due as their filing frequencies are all quarterly, annual, or semi-annual. This means we'll send a ""no filings due"" email within the next few days."

I went through all transactions with a note attached and was actually surprised at how many were accurate . For example, 74075 shows all the correct logic, following best accounting principles: - Taxable transaction - Refunded transaction - Recreated transaction as exempt On the other hand, the exact same scenario is a bust for some reason (74018): - Taxable transaction - Refunded transaction - Recreated transaction as exempt - Refunded the recreated transaction as exempt. For some of the other orders where there was an adjustment/change, I noticed we didn't create the transaction with the appropriate change, or it was just left as refunded. This was the case for 140162 and 140425. I had corrected these. In either case, the guys are going to kick a new notice your way that is mathematically sound to the transaction exports I did from BigCommerce. I'm going to take these issues to my write-up for the integration developers. Thanks! Ryan"

I wrote something to handle a comparison where the order notes field was used to look at the records in Zamp. It produces a trail to show all coinciding transactions produced on our end. This also works as a precursor to looking back at old records from before we talked about using the order notes field. The ""Difference"" log line is a comparison of the ""Order Total (Inc Tax)"" from a BigCommerce orders export to the Zamp net total after all the records. There are some examples further down the trail where the difference is more apparent. I think there were a total of 14 orders across SSM and PSP that have order notes from April. This work will continue into the end of the week, when I hope to clear getting a new notice your way from our team. As for the actual app and corrections to the integration itself, still getting the details together for the team that manage the integration. We're still closing out some prior work. Thanks for your patience,"

Any technicalities or specific configurations that caused it doesn't invalidate the fact that the API got it wrong and caused the customer justifiable frustration. Regardless, we have already implemented such functionality in our checkout process. It displays a simple warning when the address entered is marked as invalid by the inconsistent /addresses validator, and it allows the checkout to continue without sales tax calculation in such cases. Thanks, Ethan B"
2929702398,129963,8921443114,message,2025-05-12T20:35:08Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Ethan, Thanks for the response! No—I was referring to a slightly different configuration (and likely UI updates) or checkout flow to ensure address validation doesn't prevent the customer from continuing through checkout. I've seen Magento or WooCommerce implement address validation in this way and have heard from clients I worked with in roles elsewhere of similar changes (this might be a big lift, and is not necessarily required.) From our standpoint, the /addresses validation is correct as it was initially built and needs a configuration tweak. Zamp uses more data sources with higher accuracy overall, or at least simply a different way of processing the data (From the Google Maps API), which can result in variance with other address validation services. I hope this helps!"

In a situation like this and in general, it might be worth implementing some 'select an address' functionality to display the original address and the updated address, if any; if there isn't another address, allow the checkout process to proceed. In general, address validation shouldn't prevent the checkout process from completing. We also understand if this isn't an option here."

Our Engineering Team told me that Zamp viewed the address as invalid because of a data and geolocation quality indicator we have in place for address validation. Here's a bit of detail: Zamp's /addresses API endpoint is currently configured to allow only rooftop or parcel address precision confidence levels, and we receive a zip9 response for this address, but we also received an indicator that DPV = 'Y' This happens because Zamp utilizes a different address validation solution than Google, with a broader mix of data. We found a strategy here that would allow addresses with a DPV value of Y for this scenario and cast a wider net for valid addresses, an indicator tied to the data existing within a USPS dataset. We've passed along a feature request that would add the DPV item noted above to the validation ruleset, and we hope to have it released in the future. Once this is released, we'll be sure to follow up!"

We've resolved the differences, and an updated tax-due estimate will be sent out within the next few minutes. The good news is that our filing team will be able to file these returns on time, and there will be no late charges from the states. We keep these dates in mind as we work through various situations, and we'll communicate this more clearly going forward. For Illinois and Iowa filings, we have until 5/15/2025 to file on time, ideally we would file before that date. We looked into this further and found the following items contributed to the differences here: For Iowa , we found that Transaction ID 144 had a date of 4/29/ 26 instead of 4/29/ 25 , causing the transaction to be placed in a future filing period. We have updated this, and we've made improvements to prevent situations like this from occurring in the future. For Illinois , we found that the difference you noted was due to our tax-due estimate automatically accounting for the Illinois timely filing discount (also known as the 'Retailer's discount'), and that estimated amount is $398.00 . The IL Retailer's discount is applied when filing on time and is 1.75% of the sales tax collected. Please let us know if you have any questions. I hope that you have a wonderful weekend!"

Chris here with the Zamp Technical Success Team following up about the differences Tammy noted in another email thread with Caroline. We appreciate your patience with this. After further investigation, we found that Zamp had $0 listed as the estimated tax-due amount for Virginia and Illinois because Zamp views your product as tax-exempt in those states. In these situations, we can ask our filing team to file the tax collected amount instead of the tax-due amount. I understand that the Bondaware team has filed the April 2025 returns; we'll note this on the Zamp side. I'll sync with Caroline tomorrow about how or if those amounts must be recorded within Zamp."

TL;DR - I realized this is happening because Zamp views this customer's product (with the R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS tax code) as tax-exempt . So, the IL and VA notices are generating with $0 tax due. I can share a more detailed breakdown and how to spot this in ~1 hour. I'll follow up with the customer too, if that would help, but wanted to tirple-check with you first: Were they expecting us to pay the tax they collected, or were they going to refund the tax collected (Technically, over-collected) to their customers?"

We don't yet support noting timely filing discounts or the Washington B&O tax within our tax-due estimates, but our engineering team has active feature (or improvement) requests open to potentially add this functionality in the future. In the meantime, we're happy to confirm these details before filing in the future (as we've done here). Also, I do not see where we can approve the April returns to file. Yes, I will send the tax-due estimate out shortly, as this is separate from the usual Zamp app/portal. In the future, this filing approval functionality will live within a new section of the Zamp app."

To ensure we're on the same page, are we wondering why the 'Tax Collected' and 'Tax Due' values differ? If the above is the case, I've outlined our findings for the states noted below. Colorado - This difference is due to the CO's timely filing discount. Florida - this difference is also due to a timely filing discount for FL. Illinois - This is another difference due to the timely filing discount for IL. Washington—This difference is caused by the Business & Occupation gross receipts tax (0.471% of all transactions) due when filing sales tax returns in CO, which is 34.97. If the above helps and makes sense here, it appears that adjustments won't be needed for the April 2025 filing period, we can skip the adjustment imports this month, and send the tax-due estimate out, today. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I checked in with our Head of Filing, who noted that if we cannot access the Shipping address details in Target's order exports and sales tax report exports, we can place the Target Plus transactions into a zip code within that state. Ultimately, our primary recommendation is to either implement a third-party tool like Acenda (or something similar, but this isn't an endorsement) or contact Target Plus Seller Support via the Target Plus portal to find a way to obtain an export from Target Plus with the shipping address data. Working with Target Plus Seller Support is likely the best path forward here. It may involve submitting a ticket to them (or emailing them) via the 'Support' section on the left-hand side of the portal, as during our call, we saw that the 'support' option was some chatbot. When you have a moment, could you please share a CSV file with the Target Plus transaction data listed by state? I'm also happy to hop on another quick call if you'd like to discuss any of this or have any questions."

For the Target data: Possibility: Can we pick a random city, state, or zip code to associate the transactions? They can get totals per state from a sales tax export from Target. The orders exported don't contain addresses, but they contain amounts. The returns export doesn't contain amounts, but it includes a return location, sometimes."
2926052609,128982,8902147962,message,2025-05-06T14:04:43Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Sarita, Thanks again for your patience! We reviewed the Target Plus file and found that while it does contain some of the information we need, it's missing the Ship To Address details. To import and use the data in sales tax filings, Zamp would need at least the Ship To Zip code , or the Ship To City and Ship To State . Also, Zamp would need every row in the CSV file to contain amounts (discounts, subtotal, etc.) and a transaction date. Unfortunately, we haven't had to export data from Target Plus yet, as we haven't received this kind of request in the past. If we find or think of any customers also selling through Target Plus, we'll ask them how they approach it. That said, we did some research here and this is what we've found: The Target Plus Reports do not contain the shipping addresses. A third-party tool like Acenda could obtain an export that includes the Shipping address ( ChannelEngine and other tools don't appear to have this ability, but there may be others). We don't specifically endorse any tool here, as this is new to us. It might be best to contact Target Plus Seller Support via their portal using the help/support features. Target Guest Relations may also be able to direct you to the correct department by calling 1-800-440-0680. Based on our research (what we can find online), it is not easy to get the data Zamp would need for Target Seller Plus sales. If you can see a way to obtain the city and state for the orders within Target Plus, we could use that data, but otherwise, it appears to be tricky to accomplish this. If you'd like, we're also happy to schedule a call with this link to share your screen and see if we can find any way around Target Plus' limitations here. If a time on my calendar won't work for you, please let me know what days and times work for you, and I'll check with other folks at Zamp to see who might be available. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

We were able to import most of the data you sent over. However, we could not import 55 transactions with a total of $756.23 in sales tax due to underlying issues with the source system (an ERP, I believe). I've included these transactions and the errors involved as an attachment here.

Yes—we can make an exception here, considering the situation with the missing data. We'll be able to hold the filings until the end of the day Friday, May 9th, 2025. We set this date to ensure the sales tax filings are processed before the state's due date and to keep our internal filing processes focused on efficiency. We may have some wiggle room outside of that as a last resort, as our goal in filing timely is to ensure Hume Health Corp doesn't have any penalties or interest assessed by the state.

We found a few root causes related to the difference here, and I've outlined those below. Refund Transactions with discounts where the tax refunded was lower in Zamp than Shopify—our engineering team is monitoring this, and an improvement is in progress. Order Edits to Shopify orders via Shopify's built-in return/exchange functionality. Shopify's APIs don't expose much of this to Zamp, and what we've seen in the past has been inconsistent and inaccurate. Our engineering team has this on their list to explore solutions for the future. A couple of edge case-related Shopify voided/canceled orders. This is also on our engineering team's radar. Please note that Shopify's tax amounts (within the US Sales Tax Report ) have changed a bit since the initial email: We've adjusted for the differences here and will send you an updated tax-due estimate. For now and until the features/improvements noted above are released, we'll account for these scenarios before sending the tax-due estimate in the future. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

After looking into the order examples you shared, the differences with these orders occur due to a form of order editing that uses Shopify's native (but newer) return/exchange functionality. We can tell this is the case when orders show removed/added items or note 'partially refunded' OB47903 From looking at the transactions page below, we show a remaining $9 for sales tax, but Shopify shows $7.92, so we're off a bit here; that's likely part of the cause (or all.) https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB47903&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 This is likely related to this in-progress feature request (issue..): https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/40979248/card_tables/cards/8390180624 ———————————- OB50115 This one looks like an order edit, but it also uses Shopify's return functionality. We don't even have the correct tax amount because of the order edit (removing an item directly in Shopify's UI): The Zamp transactions: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB50115&timezone=US/Local&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 $0 for a return/refund and $26.56 for tax. ———————————————————————— OB49868 This one is a voided/canceled order that is related to a different, known, issue. The order was never fulfilled and was voided, which Zamp doesn't currently capture. Zamp transactions: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/cly91ak1a00s8dpclt7hkljzb/transactions?search=OB49868&timezone=US/Local&date=2025-01-01~2025-05-08 Related issue: https://3.basecamp.com/5828705/buckets/40979248/card_tables/cards/8390148844 —————————————- The solution for these: We can take the path outlined below because we don't see negative balances in local jurisdictions using this query (for Georgia at least). We should run the Shopify forced reconciliation script here: https://github.com/zamptax/zamp-technical-success/tree/main/utility/scripts/shopify_forced_recon_offset Then, after we allow an hour for the forced reconciliation adjustment transactions to be factored in, compare the Zamp notice amounts (the MB query here ) against the US taxes report to see if they're closer. I can do that today or tomorrow if that's better, or we can run through it together!"

Oracle/NetSuite support hasn't yet provisioned the free accountant user, and they also haven't provided a date or timeline for when it'll be available, when I've asked and noted the urgency.

2921967851,127211,8893471027,message,2025-05-03T00:53:35Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Catherine, Thanks so much for your patience here! I investigated this and found that Shopify support is correct here as far as I can tell, unless tax collection was never enabled for California. It seems that Shopify either defaulted to collecting taxes when an in-person CA location was added, or it was turned on at some point. Currently, the CA tax collection appears to be disabled per this Shopify taxes report. This appears to be related to the NC Crane AG location's address in San Luis Obispo County, which can be found in Shopify here . Shopify also shares a bit of detail about this here ,  when viewing this location in Shopify and on the ' Manage tax liability ' page here (also shown below): The tax collection for San Luis Obispo County and the city of CA could be correct based on the various tax rules within CA, as that is where this POS location is currently listed. We share more details about this in our California Sales Tax Guide here . We would call this intrastate sales tax sourcing, but as Shopify notes , it's sometimes called 'hybrid origin' sourcing. This type of tax collection involves collecting the California state tax, the county and local taxes of the in-person location, and the city and district taxes associated with the shipping address. The above would be correct if Semaine Health does have a physical location within San Luis Obispo County, is registered to collect and file taxes in CA, and the ' Hybrid-Origin ' tax setting was selected for CA: Zamp's sales tax API would calculate similarly if we knew that Semaine Health had this exact location. If you're not registered to collect in CA (we don't see that listed as such in Zamp) and aren't filing CA returns outside of Zamp, we recommend refunding the taxes collected to your customers if you haven't done so already. Suppose the CA tax wasn't enabled and the 'Hybrid-Origin' option wasn't selected. In that case, we'd recommend you continue to escalate this with Shopify for further investigation (based on our understanding of Shopify's settings and documentation). I understand that the above is a lot of information, which can be tricky (especially when explaining it to a customer). We're happy to hop on a call to discuss this sometime if you'd like! Do you think the above helps answer the situation here? If not, please let us know; we'll clarify! Please let us know if you have any questions, and have a great weekend!"

Unfortunately, the 'Criquet Shirts' Shopify Store access still appears pending. This is very strange, and as far as I can tell, you're doing everything correctly. Here's what we see: Is this effecting our filing process? Yes—we're currently holding Criquet Apparel's filings until we can run a bulk sync to update some items associated with Criquet's Shopify transactions. This is due to some changes made on Shopify's end, which required updating our integration. The good news is that we're on top of this and will be able to file on time for you. To file timely, we need to ensure your sales tax filings are moving into our process by Monday, 5/12/25. If needed, we have some additional time past that date, but we're hoping to keep things as efficient as possible. ——————————————————————————- Next steps: 1) Can you hop on a quick call about this so that we can screenshare? Or could you reach out to Shopify Support? I'd love to and am happy to help figure this out. Sometimes, we see delays in Shopify access making its way over to Zamp's partner account, but that's usually no more than a few hours. 2) Alternatively, could you follow the steps below to add the read_locations permission that the Zamp app now needs? I'm also happy to hop on a call to walk through this. Log in to your Shopify admin and select settings ⚙️ at the bottom left of your screen. Select ""Apps and sales channels."" Select the ""Develop apps"" button at the top right section next to the ""Shopify App Store"" button. Click on the ""Zamp"" custom app In the header section, click on ""Configuration.""

I looked into the Order IDs below further in Zamp, and the original order, exchange, and return charges and refunds all looked as I expected here, with no incorrect tax or additional amounts on the exchange or return charges. Parent order: 87533 Exchange: 89426 A refunded return charge: 91851 I've also confirmed, after researching some more, that the ReturnGo app should work well with Zamp. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a pre-built report in Shopify that would simplify partial refunds. Still, it appeared to be possible to build a report using Shopify's newer ShopifyQL Reporting after customizing one of the existing reports to look for: Metrics : Refunded payments. Dimensions : Order ID and shipping address details. Filters : Date range, an Order payment status of 'Partially refunded', and Taxes returned greater than 0. Other items may be useful here in the filters and dimensions area. Have a great rest of your week!"

Here's the Excel formula I showed during our call: =COUNTIF($C$2:$C2, C2) > 1 These are the steps I follow when using this: Download the data from Zamp.

Change 'Style' to ' Classic ' In the dropdown right beneath ' Style ', select ' Use a formula to determine which cells to format ' Paste the formula into the text box and click ""OK"". Add filters to the 'transactionId' column and filter it by color, selecting the cell color used in the conditional formatting. Delete the rows that are highlighted. The above steps will leave a single row per order or transaction within the CSV file and can help make reviewing and reconciling with Zamp more efficient.

Based on this article , Shopify Tax won't calculate taxes for an order if it contains one or more products with a tax rate override. However , it may work if the 'charge tax on this product' box is checked or unchecked. It might be a good idea to try setting these up as a shipping profile or a custom flat-rate option instead. That said, Zamp won't know how to treat these products (line items within an order) as shipping because our Shopify integration uses the order-level 'shipping' amount details to automatically handle shipping taxability; we don't currently have a shipping tax code due to this. If no tax is collected, Zamp will not remit tax to the state DOR, and that portion of the transaction(s) would be excluded from the filing. If tax is collected, we'll categorize it in our filings according to the proper jurisdictions, as most states only require shipping to be grouped with Gross Sales. Setting the taxability of these shipping products manually could work if they are marked as tax-exempt. However, we wouldn't want to apply a tax override (rate) here, because Shopify likely won't collect tax on the order. This should work with Zamp. Ultimately, I recommend checking in with Shopify Plus Support to confirm the best path and behavior when using Shopify Tax. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

After looking into this further, we want to create a refund transaction to account for this canceled order in your Florida Q2 2025 filing, and that should be the best path forward here.

2907822915,122405,8840045666,message,2025-04-17T23:39:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Ethan, Thanks for the response! Of course! Let's use this link to schedule a call tomorrow. Most of my availability is in the afternoon (EST), but I can adjust my schedule if a morning time slot is better. Is there an API limit that is silently enforced? If so what is that limit? There is an API rate limit, but it shouldn't be silently enforced. Our API rate limit was recently increased by our engineering team last week and should now be 500 requests per minute. Also could you explain why it's returning so many taxes records for a single line item? Sure! This happens because a taxes object is returned for each tax jurisdiction (state, county, district, etc.), and this occurs for each line item within a transaction. The jurisdiction ""type"" (which can vary from one state to the next) is indicated by the jurisdictionDivision property's value within the object. How do I correlate these back together? Do I sum up for a given line item? This is a good question! In a situation like this, it would likely be best to sum the taxDue amount for each lineItemId if there are multiple line items; otherwise, the taxDue value above the taxes array could be used if there's only a single line item. Regarding the $0 tax due returned for this calculation: This happened in this request's instance because Zamp currently treats line items with the general digital products tax code (R_DIG_DIGITAL-PRODUCTS) as tax-exempt in Virginia. A way to determine if this is the case is if the taxDue amount in the Zamp calculation response is 0 and the taxableAmount is also 0. I'm also happy to take a look at additional examples. As I can in the morning, I'll review some API calls sent to Zamp for the test account."

I've attached a few files for your review, along with the tax-due estimate: Per our usual process, the 'shopify_orders_export_1-edited' file is the source file for accounting for the edited and voided orders. The ' Ravella - Shopify Edit and Void Adjustments ' file is the adjustments file imported into Zamp to account for this. The 'RAVELLA Zamp Export' file contains all the transactions used for the underlying estimates and filings within Zamp. A quick note about the differences you'll see in the last file vs. the tax-due estimate: The tax-due estimate has an amount that is very much an estimate, which does not fully account for all of the CA prepayments already made (our engineering team has in-progress improvements to better account for this), and here's the breakdown of those payments: The total tax collected was $18,116.00 . The January 2025 prepayment was $6,552.00 . The February 2025 prepayment was $7,709.00 . The remaining should be closer to $3,855 . For Washington, $183.94 is attributed to WA's B&O (gross receipts) tax, due when filing returns but not collected from customers. The other states' differences are minor and within the % margin for rounding, timely filing discounts, and other state-specific tax logic. We weren't able to account for refunds that caused negative amounts in local jurisdictions in the past, but we are still tracking this and plan to work that into the May 2025 filing for April 2025. Please let me know if you have any questions. We're still working towards getting this data to you earlier in the month, but we have had some unexpected delays in the last few weeks. I'm also happy to hop on a call if you have any questions."

Sure! Our Engineering Team has implemented measures to account for Marketplace sales through Shopify's Shop app. These measures detect these transactions using Shopify App ID values provided in Shopify's Admin API Orders endpoint data. Our Shopify integration can detect this when your store's transactions sync with Zamp. Zamp will then file the sales tax returns associated with the Shopify transactions where Shopify does not collect sales tax as a marketplace. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any additional questions."

Becky and I synced about this and confirmed that we see monthly sales tax return filing options for Eastside Golf in Florida when we review the available filing period dates (called ' Collection Period ' on the FL e-file DR-15 filing): This is why FL is set up as a monthly filing state.

The difference here is likely related to God's True Cashmere's quarterly prepay filing frequency with CA, which means that Zamp makes monthly prepayments to CA before filing the actual quarterly filing. Overall, in QuickBooks Online and Zamp, I see that the total tax collected in CA was close to 12,852.00 when adjusting for time zones. The previous prepayments were: The January 2025 prepayment made in February 2025 - $2,910.5. The February 2025 prepayment made in March 2025 - $4,417.74 Total combined: $7,328.24 Remaining tax-due estimate: $5,523.76 Please let us know if you have any questions!"

I'll answer your questions below, and I'm happy to hop on a call sometime if that would be helpful. What I thought was happening is that we overpaid sales tax at the beginning so this was the credits being applied. Is this correct? Yes—this is correct! There were duplicate transactions between a manual CSV import and a QuickBooks Online integration. If so, why are we not taking the full credit for the amount owed each period? Or is it something different? The plan we discussed previously (correct me if I'm wrong, Sadh) is that we would adjust for 10% of the overpaid sales tax each month to prevent sudden changes in Gross Sales and Tax Due amounts from month to month. Another reason here is that some states don't have a tax due amount when we're filing or a filing is not due. I hope this helps!"

We'll need to investigate further, but we'll likely want to disconnect the current Amazon integration with Zamp because we have that sales data syncing separately. If the Amazon data flows into Shopify, we won't need the Amazon connection, as Zamp will handle the transactions from either source. Within Zamp, we'll always view transactions from Amazon (either the direct integration or Shopify) as $0 tax to ensure that tax is not remitted twice because Amazon collects and remits as a marketplace facilitator. The good news is that this won't cause any tax duplication but may cause duplicate amounts within Pacagen's Gross Sales amounts. However, we can quickly help sort that out. A few questions: 1) Do we know when this change was made to bring Amazon transactions into Shopify? Was it effective on 4/8/2025? 2) Was this change applied to historical (before X date) data in any way? 3) Could you or the team share examples of Shopify Order IDs synced to Shopify from Amazon? I've found a few, but I'd like to be sure. The examples I found are: #37965 #37961 #37911"

The fastest route to resolve this could be to remove the Odoo CSV file we imported and use the Shopify data to file the returns this month. That's also an option, and I wanted to confirm with you what path you'd like to take considering that information. The Shopify synced transactions' combined total tax amount for March 2025 is $29,580.29, while the Odoo file's is $29,364.86. This difference could be related to time zones. Additionally, while reviewing Joolca's Zamp account, I found that Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, and Utah all have quarterly filing frequencies, but Zamp doesn't have the January 2025 data. If we stick with the Odoo CSV import path, could you please also provide the January 2025 data in the same format as the March and February data?"

Those stores are: joolca-us-b2b.myshopify.com joolca-us.myshopify.com Should we disconnect these stores and remove all Shopify data synced with Zamp? After that, we can generate a tax-due estimate and get the filings moving. Just so that you know, the Shopify integration allows the process to be automated. Still, we're also happy to handle it this way if Odoo is the source of truth—this is the preference here—or if importing the data from Odoo instead simplifies reconciliation processes for you all."

I've reattached the sales figures for Joolca Inc. for March 2025 (this includes both B2B and B2C customers). Just a quick clarification on the data: all our transaction IDs start with INV , and credit notes begin with RINV . Looking at the file you have on hand, I noticed that by row 1163, the transaction IDs appear to have changed to numerical values only. I suspect these might be transactions pulled directly from Shopify? To confirm from our end, we use Odoo as our source of truth. The Excel spreadsheet I've provided is extracted directly from Odoo, so there's no need to pull data from Shopify. Does the above make sense, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

As requested, we've held Joolca's filings until we have your approval to proceed. Just so you know, we will need to hear back with approval to file by the end of the day (EST) on Friday, April 11th, 2025 , for Zamp to be able to process your filings timely this month. A few states, such as Maine (with a 4/15 due date) and Michigan (for the timely filing discount), have earlier due dates or timelines. I've attached two XLSX files containing the transaction data Zamp used to build these tax-due estimates. Each file includes a sheet showing the tax total per state and overall. The combined tax total across all monthly and quarterly states with due dates this month is $62,015.96 . It's important to note that the Washington March 2025 filing and estimate also include a WA B&O tax (gross receipts tax) filed with the sales tax return; this amount is $342.40 . In addition to the above, Zamp's tax-due estimates have various state-specific logic in place for handling time zones, rounding, and timely filing discounts; we share some details about this here (also here ). I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions."

We determined the cause of the differences in the QBO numbers and Zamp's notice. For Oklahoma and Texas, there was 1 transaction for each state that did not import with the automation. I have added those transactions and that will be reflected in the new notice. The transaction ID's were 25233 and 25146. The difference with Washington is due to the Business and Occupancy tax that WA requires, which was $17.97. We will get a notice over to you shortly, please let me know if you have any further questions."

What report am I supposed to be looking at? and what report do you use? This is a tricky question to answer, but generally, the Shopify US Taxes report you shared is the better report to start with. That being said, there will almost always be some differences (usually 1-2% but under 5%) between Shopify and Zamp; we share more information about that in this article . The differences are usually caused by rounding, timely filing discounts, or differences in time zone handling (Zamp adjusts for each state's specific time zone). Zamp doesn't use a Shopify Report to build our filings and ingest sales data because we use the data provided by Shopify's API. If we need to reference something in Shopify for a tax-related report, we will generally look at the US Taxes Report. When did you loose access to the Shopify store? Thanks for the access code! I just sent a request over. Unfortunately, we're unsure when the access was lost because Shopify hasn't shown us the date. This is an access that can auto-expire after 90-days. We've started some conversations with our engineering team to find ways to prevent this from happening. The good news is that this only affects our ability to view your Shopify store and doesn't affect Zamp syncing your sales data for filing purposes. I'm still reviewing the situation here but should have more detail before our call tomorrow."

Ashley and I would be happy to review this on a video call with you. Please use our scheduling link here to set up a call next week. Please note that Zamp automatically released Kings Loot's filings earlier, and the below state filings have already been processed, but we have paused the filing for any remaining states. Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Washington D.C., and Virginia. Once we understand what is happening here and determine the best path forward, we'll help determine what can be done regarding any already filed states. We will have some flexibility while working through the differences you've found and will target getting the filings for Kings Loot moving back into the process by next Friday (4/11/25). This will allow us to ensure the filings are still filed on time. A few quick questions ahead of our call: 1) Which report in Shopify are you using to work through the comparison here? Could you please share an export or screenshot of this report? 2) Could you also please share a couple of amounts associated with the states with the highest differences? 3) When you have a moment, could you please share Kings Loot's Collaborator request codes with us for the for-a-kings-loot and kingslootwholesale Shopify stores? This will allow us to request access to your Shopify store again because that access expired automatically according to Shopify's policy. This access will speed up our investigation and is separate from Zamp's ability to sync Shopify sales data. This code should be found under Settings —> Users —> Security ."

They confirmed that if you had no sales after the February 2025 returns were filed, then you can contact the states in which you are filing monthly returns and close out the accounts as of 2/28. On the spreadsheet you provided, there were 26 states you said were $0 filings and you were going to close out. Out of these 26, all of the states were monthly except for New Jersey. We are showing that New Jersey has a quarterly filing. We recommend filing one last return here for the quarter, and then you can contact the state to close out the sales tax account. Our team also confirmed that we can mark New York as the final return. In order to close out the account for New York, you'll still need to contact the state after the final return has been filed. Regarding the payment for the Zamp services, if you prefer to wire transfer you can do this in one transaction. Currently, there are 2 invoices due for the amount of $4,032.22 so the total payment that we need you to wire is $8,064.44. Attached are the wire instructions. Please reach out if I can be of further assistance. Thanks, Christine"

Can you please review the below email chain and attachments and let me know if this makes sense to you and if it changes anything for the approach to March transactions? Sure! I reviewed the email thread, and I think it makes sense. That said, the screenshot the CT of Nisolo shared appears to be from Shopify's newer reporting/analytics tooling (ShopifyQL). At the same time, it should be accurate. That is one area we're less familiar with, although we're learning more as we can. Zamp's Shopify integration depends upon the Shopify API instead of Shopify's reporting for sales tax details, which we're more familiar with. If you'd like to take the 'Taxes' amount as the source of truth here, it would change our approach, and we'll need to import some additional transactions to arrive at the higher amount. This seems like a more accurate path overall."

I've attached the files I used to import the sales data into Zamp. A couple of items to note: The variance between the raw transaction data and the amounts you estimated were still owed was likely due to refunds and partial refunds. At the same time, Zamp can use the data provided to account for full refunds; there wasn't a way to account for partial refunds as we don't know how much tax was refunded. Partial refunds are something that Shopify has limitations on anyway. The transactions we imported will arrive at the expected unpaid past taxes. Please let us know if you have any questions."

I've reviewed the data and various situations involved across all states. I have enough data and information here to work with. I'm getting the data into Zamp's template and importing it into Zamp.

Chris, any updates/questions on your end as you review the info? I know we are on a tight deadline to ensure these are all filed on time for March transactions! Also, Christine, I spoke with Matt, and he has a follow up question for you he'll be reaching out to you about re: whether or not we need to file $0 returns in certain states (rather than no action by Zamp), and also will connect with you re: the outstanding invoices. Please all note that I have taken the steps to pay for the March invoice via Stripe, but it is saying to do an ACH charge it will take 1-2 business days. Attached are the screenshots on what Stripe sent back, and I'll let you know once I'm able to confirm and process the payment via our bank once the code is sent from Stripe that's referred to. Again, may be much easier/faster to send a wire transfer, so if it would be possible for the Finance team to provide that info, I'd be happy to send a wire today! Thank you! Patrick"

2896181682,118169,8802733252,note,2025-04-07T16:02:02Z,christine@zamp.com,@chris more info from Patrick. We had a call today. I really could only answer his question about closing the states. He was also running through the data but I let him know that you'd have to review to make sure you had everything you need. I have a recording of the call if you want to review in case the explanation he provided here isn't clear. Let me know if you want me to reach out to him if there's more info needed. I'll reach out to filing about submitting the final return in NY for this March return.
2896181682,118169,8802716075,customer,2025-04-07T15:50:50Z,patrick@nisolo.com,"Christine, Chris, & Team,

Good morning and happy Monday! I am following up with a few important updates for Zamp related to the tax filings for March transactions. Here are important updates: Now that I understand that Zamp cannot close states for Nisolo, I've updated the ""Actions Needed by Zamp"" direction by state in column D of the attached spreadsheet, titled ""4.7.25 Update to 4.2.25 Copy March Transactions Zamp Nisolo Follow Up Direction By State"" and the updates can be seen on the ""2.0 Revised…"" tab. There are 10 states that we need for Zamp to take action on. These 10 states are listed at the top of the ""2.0 Revised…"" tab in the spreadsheet. Reuben & I will focus on closing all of the others in green without Zamp support given Zamp cannot help close the states. For the 5 states that need past taxes paid for, refer to the tab ""Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" for the total amount owed in each state. Also, note that the ""Order Data"" requested by Chris for each state for the relevant time ranges where we found past collected tax have all been attached to this email as hard copies, which show the orders within each individual state. Also attached to this email is a spreadsheet that shows all historical sales and taxes collected by month by year for each state (this is the sales data, not the individual orders) I tried to highlight on each tab in teal any states where there was unpaid, collected tax, and I do not think you'll need this spreadsheet. However, note that the ""Prior tax to be paid"" in column B on the ""Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" tab of the ""4.7.25 Update…"" spreadsheet corresponds with the data from the ""Shopify Sales by Month 2019 by Shipping Region sales_2019-01-01_2019-12-31 (1)"" spreadsheet. This data in Column B is what we want to make sure gets paid by state in the March transaction filings. Note, there is a discrepancy between the totals in that spreadsheet vs. what you would find in each individual state (order data) spreadsheets, I believe bc one set of tax is Net of Returns and the other is Gross of Returns. For further clarity on the discrepancy, please note the following, which is also outlined on the """"Collected Tax Dates & Ranges"" tab: Even though the date range used is the exact same, there is a discrepancy in total tax owed (Ex Nevada $12K vs. $18K) in the individual state spreadsheet data of ""Orders"" (column E or see hardcopy) vs. the (Column D or hardcopy) ""Shopify Sales by Month 2019 by Shipping Region sales_2019-01-01_2019-12-31 (1)"" file, we believe because Column E ""Orders"" is GROSS of returns but the other Column D is Net of returns. Nisolo has had around a 25-30% Return rate historically. Again, the spreadsheet hosting only the individual state's info (column E or in hardcopy) is GROSS of returns, and returns have not been taken out, and therefore tax is higher. Again, the ""Shopify Sales by Month"" spreadsheet (Column D or hardcopy) is Net sales with tax NET of returns, and therefore is the more accurate reading of tax owed that needs to be paid. Chris, once you have a chance to review this material, please let me know if you have any questions or if this gives you all that you need for Zamp to ensure the past collected tax gets filed on time for March transactions so that we can pay it and close the states on time. Thank you! Patrick"

I totally understand, as I used to forget about the WA B&O frequently, and I still occasionally get mixed up with New York's fiscal-year-based annual/quarterly filing periods. :) Regarding CA, on our end, we're showing that the amount due is close to the amount of tax collected throughout March 2025 because Zamp made monthly prepayments for the amounts noted below, and the total estimated tax collected was $1,839.00 . First prepayment: $590.20 . Second prepayment: $632.74 . Total: $1,222.94. I hope this helps! Do we have your approval to proceed with filings this month?"

The California tax-due estimate likely aligns with the tax amount due after accounting for the January and February 2025 prepayments; the remainder should be tied into March 2025 tax collection. We'll confirm this, though! For Washington, that tax-due estimate is higher because WA also has a Business & Occupation tax due when filing sales tax returns. This gross receipts tax is not collected from customers and is calculated at a rate of 0.471%. The B&O tax amount estimate is $38.80. We'll follow up about CA as soon as we're able!"

Once we've imported this data, we'll share an updated tax due estimate, as it appears (per this article) that Eventbrite should at least be remitting the Texas sales tax collected as a marketplace facilitator. We'll do some further research to confirm. We'll follow up separately regarding your questions about the tax due estimate and Shopify differences. Have a great evening!"

A quick question: Do you happen to have the addresses for these events and tickets sold through Eventbrite? We can use the 'Event Location' and Google the address, but we want to be confident we're using the correct address when importing sales data like this into Zamp. After some research, Eventbrite is likely collecting and remitting the tax as a Marketplace Facilitator, but this may not apply to some of the sales data you shared (if the event occurred in Los Angeles, CA, or New York, NY). However, we'll still want to import this data and ensure the filing/reporting correctly deducts these values."

On the Shopify transactions, can you please clarify how that works with Shopify now remitting some of the taxes for us? It looks like they may not be remitting all of it? Sure! To our understanding, Shopify is now remitting any taxes collected through the 'SHOP' channel, which is tied into a specific payment method and marketplace via the Shop app (I believe this is an Android and iPhone app). They won't remit taxes collected from an order placed on BetterWild's website. This means that shop payments or channel orders can still come through with tax that BetterWild would need to remit via Zamp's filings. A way to see this could be using this Shopify report and adding a filter for 'Filed' under 'Filed by channel' like this: How are you handling those transactions? Our Engineering Team has already implemented measures to account for Marketplace sales through Shopify Shop. You will not be remitting taxes that Shopify has already remitted. Our Shopify integration can detect this when your store's transactions sync with Zamp. Zamp will then file the sales tax returns associated with the other transactions. I hope this helps!"

I am sharing the comparison file I used during our call in case it's helpful to reference later; I've also updated it to be clearer. Ultimately, the differences were likely due to some updates or items in process on Shopify's side. Zamp aligned closely with Shopify's amounts once Shopify's various updates or processes were completed, within 1.16%.

We're aligned that we don't want you all to pay too little or too much tax. Some of the differences here are due to the time zones used in Shopify and Zamp, which I'll walk you through on our call. We have several solutions in place for these situations in the future, and I have another method to ensure the correct tax amount is remitted."

If we continue to have these issues then we will have to switch back to our previous tax provider, because we are filing a lot more then the taxes we collected which is causing us $5-$10K differences which is a lot of extra money we are paying for taxes and this is causing our team a lot of effort and time."

Can we deduct those extra numbers for May? Yes, once we've confirmed the exact difference and its various causes, we can discuss several different approaches to adjusting for it. We're currently evaluating a few potential causes of the difference, which are: Time zones are likely the biggest culprit, and we share more information here . When expanding the Shopify US Taxes Report date range, the tax amounts are higher than what Zamp estimated was due. I'm working on a transaction-by-transaction comparison between Shopify and Zamp to find the transactions that fall into this category and their tax amount. Refund transactions causing a state's local jurisdiction's tax balance to be less than $0 (or a negative amount). I look forward to our call for next week and getting this completely sorted out!"

Yes, Zamp filed for April 2025 after we didn't hear back from our emails on 5/7. That said, we've been working to determine why there is a difference here after we went through the process you and I discussed earlier in the month, which appears to be related to refunds. We have some strategies we can use to account for this if the differences are due to refunds or another item, in future filing periods. We'll have more details (For sure) by tomorrow, as we had some unexpected delays on our side. We can schedule a call for later in the day (EST) tomorrow to allow time for the investigation to be completed or next week."

Regarding the partial refunds and manually edited orders: Starting this month (or soon), for the filings that will be processed in June, we discussed using a CSV template (imported into Google Sheets) that follows Zamp's import template (attached). We will share how to prepare that file in this article . For the April 2025 transactions, I'll run our ""forced"" Shopify reconciliation script. Regarding editing orders within Loop instead of Shopify: This change would likely involve multiple pieces, and I hope the information below is helpful. Here are some Loop resources that I found about this, and it may be worth triple-checking for best practices from the Loop Support Team: Create a Return for a Customer Return Policy Settings Variant Exchange Different Priced Exchanges Advanced Exchanges Regarding outstanding state-specific items: I've also contacted Amelia about the outstanding items for any remaining states. While researching it a bit, I found that Amelia shared these outstanding items on 4/8/25 at 9:53 AM EST and followed up on 4/28/25 at 12:41 PM EST; the subject of that email was ' Re: Onboarding Call Follow up with Zamp '. I'm sharing this if it helps find the email, but Amelia will follow up as soon as possible. Here's what Amelia shared. I recommend directing any registration/account/state questions about this to Amelia or onboarding@zamp.com (if you have questions before Amelia reaches out). Great! Here is the list of states, contact details, and what we need to be able to file. Missouri - We still need to get the responsible party date of birth and ssn/itin of the person used at the time of registering in Missouri. 573-751-5860 North Carolina- Since there is no apparent registration id number outside of the SST number, you will need to call the state so they can advise steps needed - is the account is still open, next steps based on your current status, etc. You can ask them what is required by you to start filing online via non-SST or if a new registration is needed. NC contact number- 877-252-3052 Nevada- Since the login provided is not the master account login, you will need to call the state and they can advise/update the access to ensure your login is set as an administrator. Nevada contact number - 866-962-3707 Please let me know if you need any clarifications or have any questions on this. Please let me know if you or your team have any questions about the Loop Discount or the other items we discussed. We are aiming to have a tax-due estimate sent your way by Monday or Tuesday next week, after adjusting for the Shopify variances. Have a wonderful weekend!"
2893767258,117134,8892814699,note,2025-05-02T19:42:43Z,chris@zamp.com,"Notes: Causes of the differences: They don't have the loop discount turned on. They manually edit orders if a customer calls or emails in, but they don't do that in Loop; it's within Shopify. They sometimes issue partial refunds for issues, discounts, promos, leaving reviews, etc., which ties into Shopify's limitations around partial refunds, which do not account for tax. They already track order edits and partial refunds internally, and can ask the team to enter that into a CSV or in a way that it can be put into a CSV (A Google Sheet most likely.) Henry will: Ask about: loop discount editing orders in Loop This is a process change that will take some time. Tracking partial refunds. The above items will likely start this month for filing in June. For the April 2025 filing, we'll use the Shopify forced reconciliation script. My action items: Ask Amelia to give Henry an update and ask for any action items. Send the CSV article and template, for order edit and partial refunds to be shared with Zamp (for May and onward, until Zamp engineering has something in place and/or the Mod Lighting Team can edit orders in Loop."

Investigate the Shopify basic script - it uses a billing address instead of a shipping address. order id #CE1244X Upload Eventbrite - Q2 2025 - for TX. Amazon - pull those reports and import Q1 25 into Q2 25 for TX — If Shopify basic can't happen, can we import a CSV of just the tax transactions for Chakaruna."

I just sent out a calendar invite for 9:00 AM CST (10:00 AM EST for me), as I'm available from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM CST, and later in the day. During our call, we'll talk about the next steps to move forward. To help determine this, it would be helpful to log into your Amazon account during the call. Our Amazon sales data imports aren't showing any transactions for Q1 2025, which will help us verify what's happening here."

Aside from the two previously missing Shopify transactions, we found that there were some slight variances between Zamp's tax collected and Shopify's due to the manual workaround method we used here. Outside of the above, the difference was caused by the two missing transactions and what appears to be some rounding in Shopify's US tax reporting. Would you have time to discuss this and the plan to resolve it as we move forward next week?"
2893766265,117127,8840263638,message,2025-04-18T02:46:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Jessica, You're welcome! Regarding the variance between Shopify and Zamp: We're still reviewing some Shopify reports, such as the Q1 2025 Texas Transactions Report , to determine why this difference exists. Part of what we've discovered happened here is that when we used the manual workaround method to import your Shopify data, the two transactions below were missed. CE1005X CE1004X We're still working through comparing the tax amounts between transactions in Zamp and transactions in Shopify to find the remaining difference. This is a piece that should be confirmed by tomorrow. This situation is something that we will help correct and ensure doesn't happen again in the future. If you have some time sometime soon, we'd be happy to hop on a call to talk about this and the path to resolving it. Regarding the Eventbrite transactions: This part of the import process was missed, and we've already taken steps to ensure it doesn't happen again, including adding additional reminders on our end. The good news here is that Eventbrite, as a marketplace , remits the taxes it collects to the state of Texas and other states listed in their article here . This means that while we do still want to import these transactions and report the gross sales to TX , your business doesn't need to remit the tax (Zamp includes this as a 'Marketplace Facilitator deduction' on filings.) When we create these kinds of transactions in Zamp, we do so with $0 tax collected to ensure Dandy Lion doesn't pay the tax twice. Regarding the Amazon transactions: I've found that Amazon transactions did not sync over to Zamp, but I've been unable to find any errors associated with this issue. I'm checking in with Amelia about a couple of items here in the morning. We can take an approach of having our team manually download these transactions each month to ensure they are accounted for as Marketplace Facilitator transactions, similar to Eventbrite. For Amazon and Eventbrite transactions, we can include them in a future filing, such as the Q2 2025 tax filing. We're also happy to discuss this on a call if you'd prefer. We're here to help resolve this and ensure Dandy Lion is compliant; fix these data situations."

We understand where you're coming from with this and will be sure to improve. We're also happy to hop on a call to discuss this, after we've confirmed what happened. The reason this was a one-time exception and the cause of the difference is related to the email Amelia sent out a bit ago regarding your Shopify store's Shopify subscription and recent limitations implemented by Shopify. The Shopify changes caused Zamp to be unable to import all of your Shopify transactions, so we imported them manually using a workaround. I'm re-investigating the differences between the Shopify report and Zamp; I am also investigating what happened with the Eventbrite sales and Amazon sales. Please note that Amazon and Eventbrite both collect and remit (file) sales taxes in Texas and many other states as a Marketplace Facilitator. Meaning—those taxes are already paid to the state, and Dandy Lion LLC won't need to pay those taxes to the state, but each state (including TX) has reporting requirements for sellers. We share more information in this guide . I'll have an update for you about this today!"

I'm also concerned that it has taken 16 days to receive such a vague answer as to why your tax due report differs from the Shopify report, especially since it still doesn't match even after you stated that you manually imported the Q1 transactions. If you manually imported the Q1 transactions, it seems to me that your tax due amount should match the Shopify report. Could you please explain why it does not? Additionally, after reviewing the dashboard, I do not see any Eventbrite or Amazon transactions listed in the transaction tab. Have these transactions been accounted for, and what is the tax due for these transactions?

I'd like assistance in formulating a response to the customer regarding the discrepancy they've observed between their filing and the Shopify report. The difference is less than 1%, and this can largely be attributed to rounding and time zones. I’ve also identified that the customer uses the Order Editing app, which will necessitate further investigation on our part. To ensure appropriate handling of this matter, I intend to focus my initial response on the rounding/timezone issue, deferring discussion regarding the third-party app until an alignment with Chris.

We're still investigating these differences, and I will rerun some reports from Shopify on Monday to see if anything changed and compare some pieces of the puzzle at the transaction level. So far, the main difference is related to California. A few questions: 1) Does the DT Ecom team use any third-party Shopify apps that allow orders to be edited after they are placed and before fulfillment? 2) If third-party apps aren't used for order editing, does that ever occur manually by your team? 3) Do you know if any of the third-party apps within your Shopify store create orders/transactions within Shopify for returns or exchanges? Does the Redo returns app allow this? We've seen this kind of behavior within Shopify when AfterShip or Loop are used; Redo is one app we haven't run into yet. Have a wonderful weekend!"

Please note that there are some common reasons for differences between Zamp's tax due estimate and Shopify's reporting, such as time zone differences, rounding, or timely filing discounts; we discuss these in more detail in this article . Also, our understanding is that Shopify separates the tax amount you'll see in Zamp's estimates into two categories, and this means Zamp's tax-due estimate is a combination of these values for each state: total_item_tax_amount total_shipping_tax_amount I hope this helps!"

A colleague and I investigated this situation and found the following details; please let us know if you have any questions. Regarding the more minor differences: Zamp's tax-due estimate aligns closely with Shopify's US Sales Tax report when adjusting for time zones, timely filing discounts, state-specific rounding, etc; these variances are usually below 5%. The amounts in this Shopify US Sales Tax Report differ from the original list for various states. If you used this Report previously, it's possible it wasn't yet up-to-date, as I'm unsure how often these reports update in Shopify. In general, the differences noted here are mainly due to Zamp's adjustments to file based on each state's specific time zone, while Shopify uses a single time zone. In our article here , we discuss more of the differences noted above and other common differences between Zamp and Shopify. When I filter the Shopify US Sales Tax Report for the states filed monthly and then separately for the states filed quarterly while expanding the date range and summing the tax totals, it is within $78 of Zamp's estimate. Regarding Texas: The above includes Texas because the Shopify US Sales Tax report for TX and an example of the time zone differences here is the order noted below. When adjusting for the CST time zone, Order ID OB48264 in Zamp is reported as 3/1/25, but in Shopify, it's listed with a date of 2/28/25. The Shopify US Sales Tax report shows $1,075.59 in tax collected, which is $63.84 less than Zamp's total, which was recently updated to 1,139.43 (or 5.94%). We couldn't find any missing or extra transactions, and the tax amounts aligned with Shopify. I've also attached an export of the transactions Zamp is using to determine the tax due. I hope this is helpful to you. Please let us know if you have any questions. We'll need to move the filings along into the process by the end of the day tomorrow, April 15th, 2025 , to file by the state's due dates and avoid any penalties and interest. Do you approve of proceeding with One Bed's filings this month?"

Regarding California: Yes—this is happening because Zamp's understanding per One Bed's CA sales tax registration is that the filing frequency is what we call 'Quarterly Prepay,' which aligns with CA's pay monthly and file quarterly filing frequency. This does equal the monthly sales tax due in most scenarios, and we hope to improve our tax-due estimates in the future. We'll triple-check this and share that confirmation in our follow-up. Regarding the large difference you noted for Texas: This is interesting to hear. I have a few questions to help us understand why there is such a difference and the potential causes. 1) Does One Bed use third-party apps for returns/exchanges, such as Loop? 2) Does One Bed use third-party apps to allow customers to edit their orders after placing them? Is that done manually by the One Bed Team or at all? 3) Could you please confirm by sharing a screenshot or an export of the Shopify Report that you're reviewing and comparing against Zamp? 4) When you have a moment, could you please share One Bed's Collaborator request code with us?

I escalated to QBO dev team because we have properly set up items in QBO at the customer level (exempt) and also at the product level, classifying these as bakery items.

We are experiencing an issue with QBO calculating sales tax on some invoices for The Vitamin Shoppe orders. The customer is correctly set up in QBO as tax-exempt (they are a reseller).

The customer address. A few questions here: 1) Was the invoice recently updated, such as changing the shipping address? 2) What is the invoice number?

Regarding California: This Fortunate One difference is similar to Hello Molly. This difference happens because Fortunate One makes monthly prepayments to CA and a quarterly filing (a quarterly prepay filing frequency). Here's a breakdown of this for Fortunate One: The January 2025 prepayment was $2,964.38 . The February 2025 prepayment was $4,161.28 . Total prepayments: $7,125.66 . Remaining tax-due estimate: $7,030.88 Combined total: $14,156.54 . Regarding the remaining states brought up here: The following states have different filing frequencies that are either annual or a non-standard quarter: Indiana has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. Nebraska has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. New York has a quarterly filing frequency, but this is within the fiscal quarter date range , so the next return is the NY Q1 2025 return, due in June 2025. Texas: To our understanding, Fortunate One is not currently registered for a sales tax permit or account in Texas. It's possible that the tax was accidentally collected within Shopify if someone accidentally turned it on previously. Still, it does not appear to be enabled currently, as we do not see any tax collection in TX. We'd recommend refunding the tax to the customer if tax were accidentally collected. This can happen when tax is collected on an order, and the address is later changed. If you know the Order ID associated with that order, we can investigate it further within Zamp. We've seen this happen with other companies we work with ( this Shopify community thread has some details), but we do not currently know a solution. We'd recommend that you check with Shopify support about the options here. A follow-up question: Considering the details noted above, do you know if we have your approval to proceed with Fortunate One's filings this month? Once you're ready for us to file, you can also click the blue ' Review & approve filings ' button. Otherwise and if we don't hear back about this, we'll resume filing by Thursday, April 10th, 2025 , to ensure timely filings. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

January 2025 prepayment: $2,964.38 February 2025 prepayment: $4,161.28 Total: $7,125.66 Remaining: $7,030.88 We also see a total of $14k. Additional states: Indiana has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. Nebraska has an annual filing frequency, and the subsequent filing would be in January 2026. New York is quarterly with a fiscal quarter date range, so the next return is the NY Q1 2025 return, which is due in June 2025. Texas—On Zamp's side, Texas was not included because we understand that Fortunate One is not registered to collect sales taxes in Texas. This can happen with Shopify orders if the address is changed after the order is placed or if tax collection was accidentally turned on for TX at some point."

For the states where we have sales tax, can you please confirm that those states tax sales of food products? Of course! So that you know, the taxability of food will vary from state to state and from one product category (type/tax code) to another. To our understanding, the 'Nutrition Bars' category would be taxed in all those states except for those noted below. Washington D.C. —This is a small amount, and it could be leftover from the various product category changes you have been working on. Vermont —This is a small amount that could be related to the items noted for DC (above). Washington —The tax estimate here is mainly due to WA's Business & Occupation tax , a gross receipts tax not collected from customers but due when filing a sales tax return; the remainder could be similar to the two states noted above. The WA B&O tax amount is $461.35. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

VA notice: System failed to calculate 1 transaction(s) totaling $118.91, so they were excluded. One transaction was missing: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clr6g73v20006a8lippj6yh3a/transactions?date=2025-03-01%7E2025-03-31&shipToState=VA&limit=100 .

These NC transactions had the right amount of tax collected: 6538249 - 6594902 The rest of them had under collection that appeared to include only the state rate of 4.75%. Sean will check with the business owner to see if they want to pay the under-collected tax out of pocket; he'll follow up to let us know. I'm providing Sean with the under-collected NC Transactions so that he can contact their rep at GameFound (their sales platform) to see what can be done about this moving forward."

I just need to review the CSV file we imported to see if we listed shipping, etc. If so, this would be related to magic math for sure. We can sync about it next week, and I'll likely have a call with the customer to discuss."
2893739546,116922,8940157378,message,2025-05-17T02:07:57Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Sean, Thanks again for being so patient here! We've been investigating this and have found that it appears related to how the CSV was imported and how Zamp ensures only the tax collected is filed. We still have a few items to investigate and test, but it is best to schedule a call sometime next week to discuss this further. I hope that you have a great weekend!"
2893739546,116922,8938170518,note,2025-05-16T14:58:09Z,landrade@zamp.com,"@chris I'm working on it and want to share my findings and thoughts. There is no difference between the customer file and Zamp transactions. I believe the variance is related to the magic math. CSVs comparison There is no difference in the tax total, subtotal, and transaction total between the customer CSV file and the transactions in Zamp. I noticed some inconsistencies in some shipping states. When comparing either CustomerSubLocationIsoCode or ShippingSubLocationIsoCode from the customer file to the shiptoState from Zamp, a few of them don't match. However, they have the same zip code in both files, so I believe we're fine in terms of reporting. Magic Math When checking the variance review export and filtering by sectionName equal to 'General State' (the filing section where the gross sales were reduced), we see the exact amount used to file in the taxableAmount (NC = 2987.37) Question: Why was the gross sales amount reduced, but the tax due/ collected remains the same?"

For example, when I filter the March CSV I sent to North Carolina and look at the column sums, there's 3550 collected for product, 730 for shipping, and 210.91 for taxes. When I look at the North Carolina return filed, it shows 2,987.37 gross receipts. I would have expected a higher number derived from the preceding numbers. Can you explain how this works out?"

2893739546,116922,8811798217,customer,2025-04-09T21:11:26Z,slabbe@earthbornegames.com,"Hi Nick, So the problem with Gamefound is that transactions are not dated and changes are not logged. So there's no way to retroactively find the date of the transaction being finalized. So what I'm doing is running the gamefound report on the last day of the month. When I run the one for April, it will also include everything for March. Which means I'll have to reverse out all the March activity from the April report based on what I recognize in March before I send it to you. It's a pretty big hassle, but BackerKit worked the same way! So I think I would just date everything for the last day of the month, unless you see a reason to do it differently."

Would it be possible to update the sheet with the dates of the transactions from your end? Otherwise, I can use a date from March like the 15th for all transactions.

We will get the WV invoice 11490 voided, as that will be faster on our end (instead of waiting for a delete request), and that should allow me to send you the updated amounts tonight. Regarding Washington: The difference here is due to WA's B&O tax . The B&O Retailing tax is $870.21 for Q1 2025, including the possible duplicate invoice 11328. Once we remove invoice 11328, the B&O tax amount will decrease because it is a gross receipts tax calculated by multiplying the Gross Sales by 0.471%. After removing this duplicate invoice, a rough estimate shows that the B&O tax should be about $465.41 , and the overall tax should be closer to an estimate of $10,823.47. Considering the above, should we void or delete WA invoice 11328?"

I believe I found the issue, and it appears that this may be related to two deleted invoices as that no longer exist in QuickBooks Online: For West Virginia , we have an invoice 11490 in Zamp that no longer appears in QBO with a tax amount of $193.11. For Washington , we have invoice 11328 in Zamp that no longer appears in QBO. Its tax amount is $7,742.08, and it appears to be a duplicate of invoice 11444 . I've attached an XLSX file showing the exports from Zamp and their comparisons to see if the invoice number exists in the QBO export and if there are any differences in the tax collected. The tax collected amounts match, within reason for rounding, but two Zamp invoices appear ""extra."" Do you think we should ask our engineering team to proceed with deleting invoices 11490 and 11328?"

I've reviewed all of KC Consolidated LLC's filings with Zamp and can't find an amount matching this. The closest is a filing for South Dakota with a tax-due amount of $773.51. From my experience, it's rare for a sales tax return payment to be a flat $750. The closest amount I could find to this for any recent filings was the Maryland February 2025 filing filed on 3/3/25 for $754.65. To ensure we're on the same page, is the date associated with this payment this month (April) or last month (3/8/25)?"

We're both pretty busy, and I'm glad we are on the same page. We appreciate your patience while we worked through some technical hiccups (unrelated to this situation) yesterday and today. This makes sense to me, and after digging into QuickBooks Online's various articles and forums further, I'm seeing what you're saying and found the pattern where it appears currency conversions don't always work with foreign amounts, etc. Can we include the 'Exchange Rate' available in this custom QBO Report export and utilize that as a temporary workaround for part of the process? Our upcoming significant QBO integration release will help resolve much of this and increase accuracy. I've attached a file as an example. The exchange rate is usually 1.34 or 1.35 in this file. We would do this after filtering out non-US 'Bill To' addresses. I'm still happy to have a call to discuss this or any filing/data/QBO-related questions you might have. I'll be around until ~8:00 PM EST today, and have quite a bit of availability next week."

I hope you're doing well! Thanks for your patience.

To answer your questions: 1) We do have a small batch of US customers who actually do request to be billed in CAD. Oftentimes it has to do with three reasons: (1) they have a Canadian CPA employee, or (2) they hold some CAD for FX hedging. Unfortunately, those ones won't have a USD amount inherently - the two possible solutions here would just be to: Accept that the foreign amount is in CAD but just say it's in USD for nexus analysis - it's such a small batch of customers with small amounts that if that's the reason we hit nexus we were going to hit nexus next month Find an average FX rate to convert them at in order to get to the final amount 2) The foreign amount in Quickbooks is the amount in the invoice currency (so typically a US customer's foreign amount will be in USD). Now here's the issue - the tax amount and the net amount are ALWAYS in CAD in Quickbooks and we haven't identified a field that shows those amounts in the invoice currency.

Let me know if you wanna hop on a call to find a workaround or discuss any of this as tomorrow we can definitely make some time!

Cheers,

Bill"

I've confirmed we have access to LumiQ's QBO account, and I've created a Zamp Sales Tax custom report . I've asked our engineering team to remove all automatically synced transactions that use the shipping address, and the team I'm part of will manually import this data for now. A couple of quick questions here: 1) I found some invoices with a 'CAD' currency that have billing addresses within the US. Should we ignore those invoices, or is there a way (that you know of) to export them in USD from QuickBooks Online (QBO)? 2) How are the foreign amount, tax, and net amounts configured within QBO? Which one should be the USD amount? I read through this QBO support forum thread , which makes sense. So, the invoices with a CAD currency and amount/foreign amounts that are the same may have been issued in CAD. My goal here is to ensure an accurate and scalable solution in the long term for filing LumiQ's US state sales tax returns accurately. We're almost there!

Yes, I'm positive it's related to negative amounts in specific jurisdictions because the negative amounts line up with the differences. This scenario can happen anytime the two conditions below are met, and my understanding is that Zamp has behaved this way the whole time (with slight adjustments over the last year, possibly.) In these cases, an item is purchased in one month (January) and returned the following month (February, still within a 14-day or 30-day window). There aren't any other sales to that specific jurisdiction in the following month to fully cover the refund, or there are no sales to that particular jurisdiction. On our side, the transaction export is used to build the filing team's summary totals, but that summary is different; it's a state-specific sales tax internal report used to file the returns. I'm pulling data from the same source. This could also be occurring more often because we're adjusting for edited orders, voided transactions, and items that cause refunds across multiple jurisdictions. These are the Order IDs causing the negative amounts in local jurisdictions: #23832930 #23828180 #23837460 #23830180 #23834760 #23832720 #23836330 #23833050 #23822770 #23821470 #23830810 REF-6115898589436 #23835120 #23832520 #23837570 I hope this helps!"
2876711998,111998,8734137236,customer,2025-03-17T16:41:23Z,jason@shopravella.com,"Hi Chris, Yes I'm surprised we had these come up again. I thought it would be just from January because of the higher amount of returns from December orders, combined with a seasonal drop off into January. We're definitely sure it's related to the negative amounts for specific jurisdictions right? Because I don't recall this happening at all last year, but now we've had 2 months with this issue. It seems either our transaction list export is missing something, or the filing team's calculation is being done differently this year. Form what I remember last year, the excel transaction list was usually more of an 'export' of the filing team's summary -- and so the numbers would generally match since it was from the same 'source'. Now it seems our transaction export and the filing team's summary totals are from a slightly different 'source', but with the 2 sources. Thanks, Jason"

We still have some to recover from last month's filings, and we can include these additional refunds. We do have a process in place for this. Suppose this pattern continues and the list grows. In that case, we'll want to set some time aside to discuss determining a threshold for handling these refund scenarios based on the materiality of the amount. I'll approve the filings to get them moving along. Have a great week!"

After completing the investigation, I've found that all variances where the estimated tax due variance amount is above 5% are related to refunds causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions within a state. This is the primary cause for CA, CO, GA, and TN. This means that some refunds in the export I shared with you could not be accounted for because, according to the various states' rules (as noted during previous discussions/calls), we cannot file negative amounts in any state jurisdiction. For Texas, due to the low percent difference (~2.13%) and ruling out refunds in local jurisdictions as the cause, that difference is very likely related to rounding at the line item level (per transaction) when summing values for local jurisdictions. It's also possible that I'm unaware of other state-specific logic in place. I hope this is helpful. Do you know if we can proceed with the filings this month?"

We are probably good to approve right away on Monday once the filing amounts (ie the email amounts) are not higher than your worksheet amounts - since it does seem your worksheet captures all the adjustments correctly; while the email amounts may be missing some of those adjustments.

I'm re-running some background processes and giving them extra time to complete in case there's something ""stuck""/processing on the tax engine or database side. That said, a mix of the differences here could be due to refunds causing negative balances in local jurisdictions paired with state-specific rounding (e.g., IL and TN round to even dollar amounts on their filings). I may have another update tonight, but I hope to have this sorted out or confirmed by Monday. Our filing team is aware of the situation and noted that, as an exception, we'll still be able to file on Monday on time. Additionally, due to a recent improvement by our engineering team regarding time zones and transaction dates, I found a better way to export the data for the states we're filing for Ravella.

Smaller excess amounts for others such as AZ, ILK, MA as well. Can we check CA and GA, and possibly CO, NC and TN again? Thanks, Jason"

We've accounted for the refunds from January 2025 that needed to be carried forward and that information is tracked in this Google Sheet (you both should have access.) I've also attached a couple of files: An export of Ravella's transactions within Zamp for February 2025 and NY Q4 2024. I attempted to manually adjust this file for time zones by state as we're still waiting for the internal improvements to make this filtering more straightforward, and there were various database limitations at the time. The above means I could have missed something, but the amounts are close to what we share in the tax-due estimate (accounting for rounding, timely filing discounts, etc.) The Shopify Export with my adjustments for the order edit and voided order scenarios. I followed the same process as previous months, and triple-checked the work. We had previously adjusted for NY December 2024 and January 2025, those are included in the export noted in #1. With additional process and app improvements (our database migration and updates are more than 50% complete) and growth within the Technical Success Team, we aim to have these details over to you much earlier in April.

I've attached a file showing the tax amounts from Shopify and Zamp; this was used to determine the adjustments needed. We adjusted for the amounts by the difference noted in column F. The variance is slight enough to be related to time zones, rounding, and other state-specific causes; we share more details here . One essential point is that we discovered Shopify's US Sales Tax report does not include tax on shipping (' total_shipping_tax_amount ') in the ' total_item_tax_amount ' column. Shopify's reporting separately buckets shipping and item taxes; this article shares more details . This also means that the variance is a lower tax amount. As we discussed, we still plan to evaluate previous filing periods (including January 2025) and determine the best path forward for making those adjustments. This will start tomorrow and continue into next week. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

Our engineering team found that the LA issue for Leadwork, Dialect, and Database was related to a summary issue on our end due to a way LA changed reporting requirements for digital goods/services. They pushed an improvement out to resolve this, and now the tax-due estimates for LA match the expectations for February 2025. This also sheds some light on why it seemed only to affect Batch Services. Here are the updated amounts for the LA February 2025 filings: Leadwork - $543.24. Dialect - $146.10. Database - $81.70 Due to the timing and the approaching state deadline, I've approved the LA filings for all three companies."

Not just yet, but our engineering team noted they're looking into this, and I've escalated the priority as high as it can go. Once I know more, I'll update you right away! Also we received invitations to our companies again, not sure why. Yep!

We have filed some LA returns, and those customers didn't have this scenario occurring. Ashley and I also spot-checked some other LA filings and didn't find this occurring for those customers. So far, this may be limited to the Batch Services accounts. This is on our engineering team's radar; they're juggling several things. I'll let our filing team know that we can release everything except for LA, for now."

This additional observation about the first 7 days of February LA tax is interesting. From what I can tell, all transactions are included in the various database pieces. Also, I realized last night that a piece of the generated filing is missing the state-level tax calculations (which I've never seen happen before). This could be related to our recent database migration and backed-up processing queues, so I escalated this to our engineering team. If this is related, surfacing this will help us prevent this from happening. Also, some upcoming after-filing March 2025 database improvements should resolve this entirely. Our engineering team has prioritized this and will update you as soon as we know more."

Is it possible that the Database transactions were uploaded to the Dialect account along with the Dialect transactions. The Dialect difference is exactly what the Database amount should be. It doesn't solve the Database variance but it helps solve the Dialect issue.

Based on the conversation we had with Michael and Gabe, they will use the same API token for both any on-premise implementation and Adobe Commerce. Just remember that the token provided by Becky is for a sandbox account and development purposes, but since the Adobe Commerce site is still under active development, it should be safe to use on their primary site until the live one becomes available. You can find the repository for the integration here: https://github.com/zamptax/zamptax-adobe-commerce-extension/ It's also available as of this week in the Adobe Commerce store: https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/zamptax-module-zamp.html A full suite of documentation, as well as manual install if you so prefer, can be found here: https://support.zamp.com/category/78-adobe-commerce As always, please feel free to reach out if you need any assistance.

[OneTimeSecret Link] - please note this will only allow you to view one time Here's the link to get into the test Zamp dashboard using this email - mjhaveri@squariongroup.com. You will need to create a password to set up your account. API Resources -- We have a wealth of documentation available at https://developer.zamp.com/ . If you or your team have any questions related to the API or any of the information in the documentation, guides, or sales tax questions, please feel free to reach us at support@zamp.com . Calculating States -- Zamp's API works by having logic that is directly associated with the account configurations that it's tied to. For example, you wouldn't receive calculations in states we don't have your company registered in -- you'd get back ""taxDue"": 0.0 every time. To curve this to suit your early API adoption needs, we set up the following states for you. Also note that you should test all calls to the calculations endpoint with a date on or after 01/01/2024. This date represents the test accounts' ""Nexus Start Date"" for each state -- states you would want to calculate how much sales tax to collect for. On our initial onboarding call, we will configure your production account with all states you will need to calculate sales tax for, along with the associated ""imposition"" types. Imposition types determine the logic our API will use to apply the correct rate. The list of states below are ones that you should be receiving sales tax ""taxDue"" in, where the value is other than 0. Calculation states AZ CA IL NY TX Feel free to let us know if you or your team have any questions. Thanks,"

We investigated this further and found that the difference is related to the three reasons, noted below. The reasons are: 17 SplitOrder transactions from September 2024 through December 2024 were not previously adjusted for and were brought into the February 2025 filing period to assist in recovering the tax for those transactions. This was for a total of -$59.11 . 19 SplitOrder transactions occurred on 2/1/2025 which were included in the January 2025 filing in February because Zamp adjusts for the state-specific timezone in our filings. These adjustments were brought into the February 2025 filing period to ensure the SplitOrders were accounted for. This was a total of -$57.28 . Depending on the state, the remaining difference is likely related to timezone adjustments of 2/28/2025 through 3/1/2025. This typically accounts for 1-2% of a variance between Zamp and Shopify with tax collected. This would account for the remaining $21.33 difference. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

This month's filings for the February 2025 period include all Split Order adjustments like we handled in February for January. Additionally, this estimate and the February 2025 filing period includes all remaining Split Order adjustments for the September 2024 through December 2024 and Q4 2024 filing periods. Lastly, any Indiana 2024 Split Order adjustments with a date of 2/15/2025 are included, and these adjustments will be filed with your IN 2025 filing processed in 2026. Lastly, our engineering team is considering improvements to handle the differences created by the SplitOrder third-party Shopify app with Zamp's Shopify integration. We do not yet know if this is an improvement path that will be taken or when it will be released. Our engineering team is also considering different avenues of improvement that may improve this situation, without adjusting directly for the SplitOrder app. Until then, we will adjust for these split order situations each month before sending you a tax-due estimate.

Stripe sends webhook events to your server to notify you of activity in your Stripe account, such as a completed payout or a newly-created invoice. The URL of the failing webhook endpoint is: https://c69b-2401-4900-881c-a542-6dd8-4846-f7e6-9fc3.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/stripe/ You (or someone on your team) configured your Stripe account to send events to that URL. You can change your account's webhook endpoints from the Dashboard . In most cases, a failing webhook does not impact your payments or payouts. However: If you use subscriptions we rely on your webhook endpoint to notify you of new invoices. These invoices may be delayed for up to three days if your endpoint is unable to successfully receive them. If you use Checkout and rely on the checkout.session.completed event as part of your purchase fulfillment process , you should review your completed payments to ensure you have fulfilled all recent purchases. We've attempted to send event notifications to this endpoint 9 times since the first failure on March 9, 2025 at 11:58:10 AM UTC. If this endpoint is important to your application, please try and fix the issue. If you do not need this webhook endpoint, you can remove it from your Stripe webhook settings . We will stop sending event notifications to this webhook endpoint by March 18, 2025 at 11:58:10 AM UTC. Here is the summary of errors we received while attempting to send webhook events: 9 requests returned HTTP 404, indicating the URL doesn't exist. You should verify the endpoint URL is correct in your Stripe webhook settings. You need to return any status code between HTTP 200 to 299 for Stripe to consider the webhook event successfully delivered. For more details on these errors and to review your account's recent activity, you can find the full set of events and request logs on the Dashboard. For more in-depth information on how to use webhooks, we recommend reviewing our documentation . Yours, The Stripe team This email relates to your Auto Advocate Inc. Stripe account.

Yes, this looks like what we need. Could you please confirm if the points below are correct to ensure we understand the data correctly? The 'Talbots' invoices should be imported into Zamp as wholesale transactions with Greencastle, IN 46135 as the Ship To address. These invoices are: 10983 10984 10985 10986 10987 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. 10988 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. 10989 - this invoice did not have a Delivery state or postal code. One of the ' Talbots ' invoices (10990) would be attributed to Pataskala, OH. We'll import the ' Wholesale - US ' customer group invoices (Urban Outfitters) as wholesale with the provided delivery details. The ' Wholesale Australia ' invoices would not be imported as they're delivered to locations within Australia, or other countries. The exception appears to be this invoice delivered to Florida: 10917 Based on the data we've imported into Zamp in the past, the above is likely the route to take here (outside of the 'Wholesale Australia' invoice to FL) but we wanted to confirm just in case. I was curious because I have not seen any sales tax payments being made. Just wanted to double check that's correct? As far as we know, this should be correct. Within Zamp, we can see that Standard Procedure is registered to file quarterly in California. Zamp has filed the Q2, Q3, and Q4 2024 CA returns; with Q4 2024 filed in January 2025. The payment date for the CA Q4 2024 return was 1/24/2025. I hope this helps!"

I realized today that Standard Procedure won't have any filings due this month because we file for them Quarterly in California. While we'll still want their wholesale data from Cin7 before the Q1 2025 filings start in April, it's not as pressing for this month. That said, we do want to help ensure data accuracy by requesting this data each month (if it's a quarterly month, we would need it by the 5th, but we can be more flexible in non-filing months.)

So far, I don't see any missing transactions, but I'd like to be sure. From 3/1/25 through today (3/6), I found 8,383 API transactions, and since 12/6/2024, I have found 116,956 API transactions. Regarding the 500 errors from yesterday: I've attached a list of affected transactions for that period. We've confirmed that all of these transactions are in Zamp. During our review of the situation, we also found that each transaction in the file I've attached was created within Zamp, likely due to retry logic implemented within your integration.

Please confirm the dates you're most interested in us reviewing, and if those are all of the dates listed in your earlier email, we can work on that. If you have any questions, please let us know!"

We shared that this was due to background processes still running after the imports, and we'll be more careful next time. She'd love to see a report that shows the tax collected and remitted and a link to the transactions included. We shared the liability report and noted that improvements for the transaction filtering piece were coming.

Some other, more manageable, reporting way to deal with refunds when they cause negative amounts in local jurisdictions. Still investigating LA but all other states are good-to-go."

Do you see this with Entree or Leadwork? Or are those two fine? From what I can tell, this is related to some background processes that feed into the tax-due estimate we send. I'm running some tools to update those amounts, though. I'm also syncing with Ashley about if we can meet earlier than 4:30 PM your time as earlier would be better for me (I need to leave at 4:45 your time as well.)"

We only made a change to Georgia, yet the other states are off. I will need to pull the transactions file you uploaded to see what the difference is.

I just wanted to follow up about the refund/void transactions causing negative amounts in local jurisdictions for this month's various filings. I'm consolidating everything to this email to simplify our work through this. A quick question : Would you like me to send out the tax-due estimates for each company regardless of the refund transaction situations below? This might help get the filings moving along and filed on time. Now that we've isolated the transactions involved, adjustments we make to the imported data would be known, and we could move forward with your approval (if you're comfortable with it) and start the filing process once the transactions have been removed from February 2025. ———————————————————— Regarding Database: The amount negative was -21.21 in Cherokee county, GA, and the transaction related to this was: re_3QmLtFBol5ufykR402xzV3E6-void (re_3QmLtFBol5ufykR402xzV3E6) - subtotal: -378.56 and tax: -22.71 ———————————————————— Regarding Leadwork: A handful of transactions caused slight negative amounts in various state and local jurisdictions. The total is roughly— $50.42 . For Washington: in_1Qi4GkAUMWrO4Kke0x1iwzyH-refund is causing a negative amount of -$1.94 in PIERCE COUNTY - AUBURN IN PIERCE COUNTY. in_1QlV5ZAUMWrO4KketsQSsWX0-refund is causing a negative amount of -$11.31 in WASHINGTON COUNTY For Tennessee: in_1QkQbQAUMWrO4Kkel8CLRuTd-refund is causing a negative amount of -$2.31 in HAMILTON COUNTY. For Louisiana: in_1QjiFrAUMWrO4KkenAcl6zSj-refund is causing a negative amount of -$3.76 in ST. LANDRY PARISH : TOWN OF ARNAUDVILLE & PARISH. For South Carolina: in_1QeoC6AUMWrO4Kkeg8gptkyI-refund is causing a negative amount of -$2.00 in AIKEN COUNTY. in_1QkYk3AUMWrO4KkeIAqnbNN5-refund is causing a negative amount of -$5.18 in ANDERSON COUNTY. Important note: The total refund tax amount here is -$6.93 . in_1QlAeAAUMWrO4KkeRj0LSsk6-refund is causing a negative amount of -$22.92 in DILLON COUNTY|UNINCORPORATED. ———————————————————— Regarding Dialect : A few transactions caused slight negative amounts in various state and local jurisdictions. The total is roughly— $22.16 . For Georgia: il_1QlzLfJIiKmDbvJMW4imS2Pu-void is causing a negative amount of -$7.14 in COBB. For Louisiana: il_1QgquLJIiKmDbvJMoj2JmgdM-void is causing a negative amount of -$14.60 in LAFAYETTE PARISH: TOWN OF YOUNGSVILLE. il_1QgquLJIiKmDbvJMbMC53u6M-void is causing a negative amount of -$0.42 in LAFAYETTE PARISH: TOWN OF YOUNGSVILLE.

Our engineering team recently released multiple improvements that should prevent this behavior.

2865750270,107875,8696091849,message,2025-03-05T04:16:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Michelle, Thanks for bringing this up! Yes—this can happen, and I usually like to bring up/cover this item. Is it ok to report the last month's transactions to Zamp so that any refunds can be reported successfully? What is the recommended way to handle this? Yes, this is 100% OK! Zamp generally recommends importing sales data back to January 1 of the previous year (in this case, 1/1/2024) for nexus analysis. If refunds are involved, it's best to do this via the API instead of a CSV to ensure the relationship can be made between refunds that can occur in the future (depending on when orders sync to Zamp.) We'd recommend backfilling (syncing) transactions from last month directly with our /transactions API endpoint. Still, we recommend keeping the request volume to 2-3 requests per minute to avoid any rate limits. There are plans to increase or scale this in the future, but those are further down the line after additional database improvements, various internal decisions, and roadmap priorities. Typically an async/await pattern with a delay will work here. Here's a basic JavaScript example I've shared to handle this kind of sync while ensuring to be under the rate limit: await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); This could be done using an existing integration if your integration supports it, or we'd recommend building a separate but related feature to handle this kind of logic (a manual sync/backfill feature can be helpful if needed). Do you think the above helps here? Can we assist with any other questions related to these refunds or the approach to take?"

Our engineering team is working through various items to improve the handling of voided/canceled Shopify orders and exploring a recently discovered alternative improvement for dealing with edited Shopify orders. The improvement of the edited Shopify orders is in a highly exploratory phase. It may take a while to sort out because of the way Shopify handles these situations in the API endpoints we use, the very little information provided. This means we'll need to continue doing these adjustments each month, but there may be an end in sight, although we're unsure of the timing."

I've confirmed that the NY tax-due estimate has changed to 15,687.64 and stayed at that amount; this is close to the amount you noted. Slight variances can occur here due to state-specific tax logic (e.g., rounding, time zones, etc.). We will be able to ensure timely filing as long as we can move the filings along by this Friday (3/14/25). Regarding CO: I've looked into this further and have been unable to find missing or different transactions. The Shopify US Taxes Report (which won't always align with Zamp) shows an amount of $925.25 and the Shopify Orders View here also shows similar orders/details. There's one extra order, 6959730622526/HOS4524407918 which is tied to a gift card and is treated as non-taxable within Zamp. The Zamp CO tax-due estimate also includes a timely filing discount, which is called a 'Service Fee' in CO; that amount is 16.27. I've attached an export of these transactions to help simplify our investigation here. Do you see any differences? Would you have any thoughts to share about the above?"

I've resolved the difference for New York as we now see a tax due estimate of $15,687.64. This was related to some database items; we have multiple ongoing engineering initiatives to improve this. Our filing team has checks in place to review the data before filing, but it's good to find and resolve these at other points throughout the process. I'm still investigating Colorado and hope to update you later today. Once these have been sorted out or confirmed, I'll send an updated tax due estimate your way."

Regarding the items remaining from the revisions you noted: For the transaction ID R-971545706558 shipped to California, we did not import a revision because the original transaction occurred within January 2025, and tax was paid for that order. $62 in tax was remitted to the state for the January 2025 because the original order on 1/25/2025 was included in that filing. $62 in tax is deducted from the filing for the February 2025 period because the refund was processed on 2/18/2025. Regarding R-972121866302 also shipped to CA: This transaction's revision or offset was accounted for with transaction ID 6975365513278-adjust in the CSV file I shared. We'll denote this more clearly the next time we need to make adjustments like this. Thanks for your understanding! Regarding R-970141925438 shipped to NY: This transaction's revision was accounted for with the transaction ID 6937431703614-adjust within the CSV file I shared.

Regarding the adjustments: I'm investigating this again, and I believe I left out some explanations for why I didn't offset them, but I will follow up today after I confirm. Regarding order edits: Our Shopify integration does not know when these order edits happen or the changes made because of how Shopify's Admin Order API is designed; our engineering team let us know that order edits are unsupported. Additionally, Shopify's order exports (from this page) do not show these order edits and retain the order's original amount. That said, we understand the business side of this situation, and it's a tricky balance with Shopify between being understandably customer experience focused and ensuring revenue retention. In these situations, and for now, we could help adjust if we are informed that an order edit happened, and the amount differences are shared with us by transaction ID."

Is it that Shopify is not pushing the new tax information associated with the revised order? I can reach out to Shopify support about this to see if it is something they can modify. It is very important for us to be able to maintain this option because in many cases we lose out on a lot of revenue when we request a customer cancel and re-enter a new order - in most cases they simply don't. ___________________ Bijan Gharavi 310.279.7090 Bijan@Spoils.cc HouseofSpoils.com

We've completed our review and the work to adjust for the differences that you've noted. Most of the transactions were voids/cancellations, and our engineering team is working to improve that (we're happy to help adjust for this). One item listed in the sheet was R-971545706558 and I left this transaction as it is because it was a refund for a January 2025 order ( HOS4524365218 ) which ended up in the February 2025 period due to the date it was refunded. This one fully refunded the tax associated with the original transaction. Please note that Order ID 6949117952062 (Shopify Order: HOS4524395718 ) was an edited order. While we understand that editing orders typically provides the best customer experience, our integration is unable to support these because Shopify's APIs do not expose all of the necessary details surrounding order edits to our integration. This means that we highly recommend against editing orders and instead creating a full refund and a separate order. We can adjust for these occasionally to help, but we won't be able to do it regularly if the volume of those kinds of edits grows. I've attached a file that was used to adjust for these differences, and we'll soon send out a tax-due estimate. Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a wonderful weekend!"

As of March 1st we have started paying our sales tax up front at time of purchase to eliminate paying this monthly sales tax. Let us know if you have any other questions. Thanks"

The report can be accessed here . I've also attached a version of it to this email. A couple of quick questions: For Zamp or any sales tax compliance solution, we need an address associated with an invoice to report the invoice properly within state jurisdictions. 1) Should we use the billing address for the invoices without a shipping address, or would your team need to update the shipping addresses? I'm asking because many invoices, including those with sales tax collected, do not have a shipping address. Sales tax calculations and filings are based on the shipping address for physical products. 2) Also, is it correct that your invoices without sales tax would be considered wholesale/resale or tax-exempt for another reason? These questions will help us understand your data and ensure we file your January 2025 sales tax return accurately. Once we hear back about this, we'll import the data and let our filing team know to proceed with your CO January 2025 filing."

While we're still working to resolve this, we wanted to offer another option that will help us move forward with the January 2025 filing. When you have a moment, could you please add filing@zamp.com as an accountant user within your QBO? Intuit shares how to do that in this article . Please let us know if you have any questions.

Compare that file's tax amounts to Zamp by Order ID (or order name) and find the difference. Sum the tax amount by order id. Sum the net sales amount by order ID. Create a refund transaction to offset the difference between Zamp's transactions and this Shopify report. Copy over all the transaction details and use the amounts from the Shopify report as the refund (or positive) amount. This includes the PTC and address details (those are important to continue to include.) We should do this for February to get the filing moving. Then, figure it out for historical periods where we filed. cc: @lucas - we could use your script for inspiration here and I also have some ideas."

Regarding the sales tax filings, I'm reaching out about our customer, the Human Rights Foundation (I emailed you about them last week). They recently provided a Tax Exempt form issued in 2006.

If you're able to copy data from our sheets into templates we could happily provide our ongoing tours each month. Would that be easiest? My only concerns here are that until we scale and staff properly, we may make mistakes. The best way is to can ensure we do this properly would be to send links to all our ongoing tours monthly. Is that manageable? Each shoed would look like the attached screen shot below.

Some months we have several tours and some months there will be none! As it stands there's only 3 tours on our schedule for the year and 1 is about to wrap up on Saturday (the one in the screen shot below)

I will review the various email threads (and notes) regarding past situations, and then I can share some recommendations. One way could be to have a separate sheet (or file) containing the tour merch revenues completed for the month by the 1st to 3rd of each month. This approach should be OK, but one sure way to avoid any differences would be to use our CSV template and provide us with the data each month (after any currency conversions and validation on your end). We could also share the data with you after processing and before importing into Zamp (if preferable.) One item we'll do on our end, is ensure we only copy/export/record data for the current month using the 'Date' column and the data highlighted in the screenshot below:"
2864676934,107561,8695219227,customer,2025-03-04T21:01:15Z,crispin@goodmerchonly.com,Ok that works. There have been instances of errors being made when calculating tax owed in the past for our touring revenues so if there's any methodology we can use to create checks and balances and verify the amounts being remitted that would be ideal. As an alternative we can focus in on a system on our end to facilitate accuracy here. Let me know what you think. Crispin Day (he/him) GOOD MERCH ONLY WWW.GOODMERCHONLY.COM 416-473-4632

We understand that handling this for a full tour would be more efficient and a preferred path here. That said, Zamp would need the data monthly because the states noted below require Good Merch Only Inc. to file monthly, and we'll need the data to process filings accurately each month, keeping compliance in mind. These filing frequencies can change as each state's Department of Revenue determines them. As of right now, the monthly filing states are: AZ CO DC GA IL PA TX VA For this month, we'll pull the data for February 2025 to ensure that is included in the tax-due estimate and filings. We can continue to do this in the future as well."

We'll work on importing the February 2025 sales data and once that's imported, we'll send a tax-due estimate. Regarding Nordstrom: To import the data into Zamp correctly at this time, we would need the amounts for these transactions separated by zip code or city + state. This is what we'd consider a best practice here because we need the address data to build our filings and properly ""bucket"" transactions to a specific state. To my knowledge, we do not have a specific connector for Nordstrom. Our account management and onboarding teams are investigating the options surrounding NetSuite (in case that is related to Nordstrom.)

After investigating this further, I see that this situation appears to be limited to the address used. I'm escalating this to our engineering team for this address and the specific scenario to be investigated further, for a potential resolution path. Sometimes this can happen with address data. I've seen this happen in previous roles where I worked with address validation API endpoints; occasionally, the USPS cannot find/validate addresses. In my testing of a handful of other, random, addresses, I also confirmed that our address validation worked for those addresses. Have you seen this happen with any other addresses and transactions? If so, I can include those in my escalation and further investigate myself."

A null response means the address wasn't found per the API docs : Smarty does validate this address, though, so it appears tied to something with our API: Note: The ""Freeman"" portion isn't part of the address; it is likely a business (warehouse) name.

We're still exploring this within Zamp's data, it would be more doable to sort out how to build this kind of report within Shopify. We could build a custom export like this more quickly within Zamp in the future (after some upcoming, phase 2, database and infrastructure improvements are released towards the end of March.) We'll still explore both angles but Shopify will be the priority here and I'm looking into how we can do this with Shopify's new ShopifyQL reporting/analytics features.

The options are: Create a ""Fake"" transaction to bring it forward into LA's current (February) period. They can amend the return because we didn't know about it until after the filing was approved and processed. Our integration won't catch changes like these, especially if a separate refund is not created. In case the customer asks, the best process here within QBO would be: Create a complete refund transaction of the original order (likely a credit memo). If filings have already been released, e.g., it's past the ""hear back by""/approval date in the filing notice), they'll need to create it with a date in the following filing period. Recreate the invoice without tax."

Yes—we still need the Collaborator Access Code here to complete our investigation. When you say it auto expired, does it mean you are not able to access our store for tax purposes? No—our Shopify integration can still sync data from your Shopify store. The access auto-expiring is related to the separate access provided for us to log into Shopify's Admin and view your Shopify store. This is the access that we'd need to review tax settings, view orders, export orders, etc, and it's a portion of our access that allows our continued investigation. The sales tax filings will continue as they have and won't be affected by this kind of access expiring. Please let us know if you have any questions. We should be able to complete this investigation as soon as we have regained collaborator access to Shopify (via that access code, and a new access request)."

I'll have more detail to share tomorrow and can likely share a broader data set this week. The heart of the situation here will be that Zamp uses multiple time zones in our filings because our team found that adjusting for the state's time zone was the most technically compliant approach regarding sales tax filings across all states. This means that Zamp would use a PST time zone for CA, an MST time zone for CO, a CST time zone for IL, an EST time zone for OH, etc. Shopify uses a single time zone for its store, which is usually the primary location for the store. We share more information about this in our article here . Zamp extracts data from the 'baby bub' Shopify store when an order is placed. We do this via Shopify's Admin Orders API (and possibly a few other API endpoints). We receive the data in UTC and have some checks around dates/time zones. Then, Zamp adjusts for the state's specific time zone and various state-specific sales tax requirements. This means lining up data 1:1 between Zamp (and many sales tax compliance solutions) will be tricky. However, this will be simpler if we focus on a single state, California. We're happy to help explain the various pieces and share the data. We appreciate your patience and understanding! A couple of quick questions: What time zone is your Shopify store based in? This will help me understand the potential differences. Also, when you have a moment, could you please share your Shopify store's collaborator access code ? It appears Zamp's access auto-expired as that can happen every 90-days."

Noticed that there are a few transactions of 1st Dec included in Nov and some transactions of 1st Nov are not included. I am sure that you are making adjustments in Oct month calculation by including the 1st Nov transactions and in Dec month by excluding the ones considered in Nov. But how do you keep a track and more importantly, how are we going to double check? Coz if we extract data from 1st Nov to 30th Nov, we will not be able to trace the exact value of Sales tax until we get a calculation from your side. In short, just want to understand how you extract data for a month? So that I follow the same steps to double check. Here are the snapshot from excel working: 1) Highlighted are the Dec transactions 2) 1st Nov transactions. Only 12 in excel but there are 18 in total:"

I've attached an export of your California November 2024 transactions, which were used to calculate the California prepayment amount for that same month. A few items to note about this file: The tax used in our calculations is listed in column J ( transactionTax .) This is an export that I modified as a one-time exception to be what we call ""transaction-level,"" which means that it does not have the usual line items shown in our exports. This was done to simplify summing the tax and other amounts, but we can share a line item file if you'd like. (Note: line item files have order IDs and transaction-level (tax, subtotal, discounts, etc.) repeated; summing them in Excel can be tricky.) The Transaction IDs shown in the file are in column B ( transactionId ), and we have access to this ID via Shopify's API. Within Shopify, this ID is available in an order's URL, and you can still search for orders via these IDs in Shopify Admin. In a Shopify order export, this ID is included in column BD (titled Id .) The date listed in column L ( transactionDate ) is a UTC date and our filings convert these dates into the state's specific time zone; we share more details in this article . I hope this is helpful to you. Please let us know if you have any questions! We're happy to schedule a call if needed as well. Have a wonderful weekend!"

We are always happy to help and I'm glad that you are having a good experience with Zamp.

This is interesting, and I've been reviewing various logs involved in the calculation process. I haven't found a calculation for this address where the tax-due amount was more than $66.85. A few questions: 1) What was the Order ID associated with this in BigCommerce? 2) On your end (anywhere), do you see an indication of when the quote was provided on 2/18/25? I've looked at logs for 2/17, 2/18, 2/19, and 2/24, and I don't see tax calculations coming to Zamp with more than 66.85 tax due returned. 3) To ensure we're on the same page, was this screenshot from an order within BigCommerce?

Here's where this can be seen in the quote : Once this quote's zip code is updated, the sales tax calculated should be 6% instead of the fallback rate of 10% because Zamp will recalculate the tax when that change is made. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions. Have a great weekend!"

The amounts should be closer in general. However, there will still be some variance (usually under 5%) due to differences in reporting and state sales tax-specific logic within Zamp (e.g., rounding, time zones, timely filing discounts, etc.). If you have any questions after reviewing the tax-due estimate sent earlier, please let us know!"

Just a quick question, what does CSV mean and what are the transactions under CSV? The 'CSV' column is a bucket of transactions imported into Zamp via a CSV file instead of Shopify. The CSV column is where the previously missing Shopify transactions (imported manually) will be totaled, and any Quickbooks Online transactions from January 2022 through July 2024 were also imported via CSV. Our Taxes Collected Report will total (bucket) amounts by the integration type: Shopify, CSV, API, etc. I hope the above helps!"

After reviewing the stores involved again, the Shopify sales data syncs on our end, and we have confirmed with our engineering team the causes of the missing Shopify data. Those causes are: The transactions were missing for the Chuckle Sandwich store because the initial bulk sync for historical data from Shopify only included 1/1/2024-1/28/2024; it was a typo when initiating the sync; we'll catch these better in the future. For the Flashgitz, the missing transaction (#FLG8425) failed to sync to Zamp because of an invalid address. During our transaction sync process with any Shopify store, we attempt to confirm that the address exists. If it does not, we cannot import the transaction (this happens very rarely). The above also means that this is not a systemic issue and should be a one-time situation. Lastly, I've also audited all of the historical imports for the stores noted below (these have been connected since 12/1/2024) to ensure this kind of date-related typo scenario hasn't happened with other stores, and we're all set, in the clear, with these.

We're happy to help with the Shopify exports, but we would need to rework the Zamp collaborator access to include the order export for all stores. I've also reviewed the last six months of sales data sync processes from Shopify to Zamp and confirmed that the transactions (I have access to a record of) that failed to sync were international (non-US) transactions.

After investigating this further, the amounts shown for the payments to the various state DORs are correct and match the sales data within Zamp for Oats Overnight. This applies to each state noted in the screenshot: AR, SD, RI, GA, and TN. The reasons for these differences vary: For Georgia, the difference was a $4.32 vendor's compensation credit/discount from the state of GA for timely filing. RI matched the initial notice. The difference was primarily caused by Shopify Transactions imported after the tax-due estimate was sent for AR, SD, and TN. These transactions occurred within January 2025 but were imported on 2/4/25 or after. I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any questions!"

SD - notice: $2,497.94 - payment - $2,556.34, matches return and report . The discount is listed on the report but not taken, likely due to when it was filed or if the discount doesn't apply. RI - notice: $147.80 - payment - $147.80, matches - didn't look at return/report. GA - notice: $144.00 - payment - $139.68, matches the return and report . The difference is due to a $4.32 vendor's compensation (timely filing discount.) TN - notice: $14,229 - payment - $14,306, matches the return and report . So far, while I'm unsure of the cause of these differences, it is okay and normal. GA, at least, was due to a timely filing discount. Looking at the attached exports, we can see with the zampcreateddate and the zampupdateddate , that there were quite a few transactions imported between when the notice was sent (2/3) and when the filings happened. This appears to be the main cause."

I reviewed this month's Colorado, Tennessee, Washington, and Utah filings to see if we could move any of the December 2024 transactions forward into the January 2025 filing period. I found that we're currently unable to move the majority of the transactions except for transaction ID in_1PcGU0AUMWrO4KkeZKfUhxFS-refund (the tax amount was—$10.20) because the local jurisdictions affected either don't have enough tax due or do not have enough to account for the full refunded tax amounts.

I'm also creating a Google Sheet to track this month-to-month and can share this with you once it's ready. A quick question: Can we get a list of all the transactions (as you've provided in the SQL5 files like the one attached) for the 7/1/24-10/31/24 and 12/1/24-12/2/24 transactions? I could not accomplish what I hoped with the shipping address (line 1) and the zip code you provided on 1/12/24. Please let me know if this is a bunch of extra work or not possible. If that is the case, I'll explore alternatives (such as a much more involved script for API calls on our end), or we will need to wait until various database scaling improvements are released sometime in Q1/Q2 2025. My goal with gathering this data by state is to ensure we're correctly offsetting the duplicate taxes by stat,e and my previous ideas (to save you all time) haven't worked as hoped. :)"

The other states that were filed were zero dollar amounts so there wouldn't have been any payment needed. You can always take a look at your Zamp dashboard to see any specific filing and your transactions. You can go to app.zamp.com and login.

We worked with Ryan and updated a few items that helped us solve this situation. To avoid this confusion in the future, we'll work on updated documentation and improved scripting on our side. I've imported your January 2025 data, and you should receive an updated tax-due estimate within 1-2 hours. I've attached some files to show the data we exported from QBO to accomplish this and the file we imported into Zamp. Here they are: The first file, "" file.xlsx ,"" is a combination of QBO exports; we used this as the source data. The second file, "" TechTradeSolutions - QBO Export - 01JAN2025-31JAN2025.csv ,"" is the file we're importing into Zamp to rebuild the tax-due estimate. After reviewing the data, all missing invoices were present except for the TX invoice ( 30099 ) because, within QBO, it's dated 2/5/2025. This means we'll import that invoice next month for the February 2025 TX filing due then. As soon as we send you the tax-due estimate, we'll need to hear back from you about approval to proceed quickly today or tomorrow to ensure we can complete the various state sales tax returns by the due dates. Florida has a tricky set of due dates and payment expectations, so we hope to move sooner than others."

Unfortunately, on the Zamp side, we haven't run into this error recently. Any memories of resolving similar errors are from a while ago (at different roles/companies); only vaguely remembered. Currently, Zamp does not have an integration with Google Merchant Center. That said, it does appear that it could be worth double-checking the following items within the Google Merchant Center: Please ensure the prices within Google Merchant Center are not tax-inclusive, meaning tax is excluded. Confirm or update the tax settings within Google Merchant Center to match your BigCommerce store's. This will ensure that both stores enable taxes for the same states. In this article , Google shares how to access the tax settings and some basic steps. Confirm whether the product or tax categories match those of Google Merchant Center and BigCommerce. Here are the states that we'd want to ensure are enabled within Google Merchant Center: We're also happy to hop on a call to review this with you, and a call can be scheduled with this link: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min ."

Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do other than escalate it to the builders to see if they have any ideas, but I doubt that will go anywhere, although it would be great to solve this. This is ultimately something they'd need to bring up with Shopify. One possible resolution is to cancel the original order before payment or process a full refund. Then, a new order with the corrected address could be placed. However, this isn't a good or efficient process, and they likely wouldn't like the customer experience involved. Others are aware of this, as far as I know. Matt Grattan brought this issue up with one of his Shopify Product contacts during the various calls/emails about MUDWtr issues."

IE: This order would not be filed to NV, but would be filed to OR if it was a state that we filed with. In theory, There is a lot of problems with this. I am aware that this on the OPS team for Look Optic. There s a lot of orders that the shipping address ends up different, as each state I pull up shows taxes for different states.

Regarding order number 475047LK, we recommend reaching out to Shopify to discuss this further because our understanding is that Shopify doesn't update the tax calculations after an address is changed on an order in this order's specific case. However, Oregon does not have sales tax so you will most likely need to refund the customer. This tax was not remitted to the state of Nevada as the transaction came to us with a ship-to address of Oregon. I hope this helps to clarify, Ashley"

Unfortunately, Shopify does not re-calculate the tax or remove tax calculated for another state when a shipping address is changed on an order. Shopify keeps the tax initially collected. So, ultimately, they should refund the tax here because OR doesn't have sales tax. The order shows up in OR within Zamp, but with tax collected because of how Shopify handles this."

I believe that I answered this through another email thread with Becky, and I've shared that answer below. Please let me know if you have any questions! I'm jumping in to help answer the outstanding API question. So that you know, any API (or technical) questions can also be directed to support@zamp.com ; those questions can also be routed to the team I'm a part of. 🙂 How would a refund transaction affect reporting for the following month? Would it just be netted against the transactions of that month? For example, if a Jan 26th transaction is refunded on Feb 6th, that negative amount on Feb 6th would be used to offset the transactions in Feb. Yes, if a refund transaction is created within Zamp on February 6th, 2025, it will be netted against the transactions for February 2025. The other option is not to create the transaction within Zamp. Instead, someone on the Wayo team would file an amended return with the state associated with the transaction to recover the refunded sales tax."

2840808385,99788,8631200109,message,2025-02-12T18:29:20Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hi Taylor, I'm following up with a quick update here! We reviewed the differences you noted between Washington and Nevada and found they are expected. I'll share more details below. Overall, the cause of the difference relates to state-specific sales tax logic built into our tax-due estimates (and, by extension, our filings) that are not accounted for when looking at a raw tax collected amount within BigCommerce, Shopify, Volusion, or other systems. Regarding WA: You noted that $1,376.30 was collected in tax, and the tax-due estimate from Zamp was $1,492.27 . The difference here is $115.97 . While reviewing the filing details associated with the WA January 2025 return, we found that most of this difference is due to the WA B&O tax. This gross receipts tax is not collected from customers and is due when filing sales tax returns. This amount was $147.39 . Please note that state-specific rounding and time zone differences ( noted in this article , which mentions Shopify, but these scenarios can apply to other platforms/carts/systems as well) are likely responsible for the overall difference. Depending on the number of transactions and the state, these two items can cause variances of a few dollars up to hundreds of dollars. Regarding NV: You noted that $617.61 was collected in tax, and the tax-due estimate from Zamp was $660.10 . The difference here is $42.49 . We reviewed all of the Nevada transactions from multiple angles, looking for any potential missing transactions or situations that might cause differences; we could not find anything that raised concerns. The difference for NV is also likely related to rounding or a time zone difference between the transactions you're viewing in your reports and the time zone Zamp uses. In NV, Zamp's estimates and filings adjust for transactions that fall within the Pacific Time Zone (PST), which can cause transactions to occur at the beginning or end of a filing period (the first or last day). I've also attached an export containing all transactions synced with Zamp shipped to customers in Nevada; the amount is close to your initial amount. We also share some details about our filing notices and tax-due estimates that may be helpful in this article . Do we have your approval to proceed with the Dorm Company Corporation's filings for January 2025?"
2840808385,99788,8631012912,note,2025-02-12T17:35:16Z,chris@zamp.com,"WA - The difference is $115.97; Zamp has a higher amount. The difference is likely just B&O tax plus rounding. The customer's noted difference is $115.97, and B&O is 147.39, which is $31.42 greater than the difference here, and that small of an amount is likely rounding. NV - the difference is $42.49; Zamp has a higher amount. After exporting NV transactions, we get an amount of about $621. The differences here are likely related to rounding and time zone."

2839446992,99080,8720452681,message,2025-03-12T22:50:17Z,chris@zamp.com,"Hello Kayley, Jackie, and Team, Thanks again for your patience! We looked into this from multiple angles and found that the primary cause of differences in the January 2025 filing processed in February was related to two items, which I'll note below. The first item concerns a limitation of Shopify's reporting, and the second concerns the Loop Discount being disabled within Loop, as AvaTax requires (which is the opposite of what Zamp needs). The Shopify Sales tax by Region Report does not appear to include POS or in-person store sales. This accounted for $47,110.05 of the difference. The Loop Exchange orders were duplicating tax on a small subset of orders, ~80 orders in January and another ~80 in February. This accounted for $3,737.42 of the difference. The above means that $3,737.42 in tax was overpaid out of the initial estimate of $50,001.50 . The good news is that we're adjusting for that this month for any monthly filings and in future filings for any non-monthly filings. Here's a breakdown based on the original figures shared from Zamp and by Jackie in February: Regarding the Shopify Sales tax by Region Report : When we exported transactions from Shopify, we found that there weren't orders missing within Zamp when comparing a Zamp export to the Shopify export. Here's what we did in this Report to sort this out: When we sorted the 'Is POS sale' column descending so that 'Yes' was at the top, we found that there were only two indications of this at the top for FL and CA. Here's what this looked like: We also found that the number of rows with 'Is POS sale' did not increase or change when we grouped by the Order ID: In the above screenshot, it appears to account for only two orders. The query powering the Shopify Report likely needs some additional tweaking or filtering. This report is a newer release from Shopify using their ShopifyQL option, and we're still learning more about it. This could be related to the lack of a billing or destination address for POS orders, or some specific quirk to how Shopify built/queries this report. We could help you determine the best way to deal with that report and improve the data it returns, but Shopify Plus Support can likely help more efficiently. Please let us know if you'd like to schedule a call with Ashley and me. Regarding Loop Exchange orders duplicating tax: As we discussed on our call, this is a situation in which Zamp needs the opposite of an AvaTax setting requirement. We will raise this issue as a feature request to our engineering team and ask them to explore accounting for it in future improvements. For now and in the future, we will adjust for this manually by creating 'refund offset' transactions to remove the duplicate tax, and we'll eventually have a way to exclude these transactions altogether. I've imported adjustment files to offset the duplicate tax from Loop Exchange orders into your Zamp account for both of the months below: January 2025 - recovering $3,737.42 in sales tax. February 2025 - ensuring $3,165.80 in sales tax is not duplicated. Once the adjustments are processed, we will send you a tax-due estimate either tonight or tomorrow (3/13). Please let me know if you have any questions. If it's better to talk through this, I'm happy to hop on a call ."

These transactions duplicate the tax, inflating the tax amount paid. Sum the tax associated with all POS location (in-store location) transactions from the Shopify export for January and February. Do that by state to share with the customer. Compare against the sales tax by region Shopify report—the suspicion is that this report doesn't include POS/location sales. This is likely a limitation of Shopify's reporting. Going forward and after this week: Investigate the differences between the Zamp variance review and Shopify exports, and figure out why. We want to figure this out for January and previous periods to see if there's a larger issue."

I split up the exports to speed them up and ensure that we didn't need to request all data from all states and sources for December since that only affects NY. The exports are: A file containing NY Web/online store transactions for December 2024. A file containing NY POS - in-person store transactions for December 2024. All transactions for February 2025 - including international. For the full-month, all transaction exports: February 2025 - all sales data (filtering only by date) applies to the January 2025 export above . We'll need to filter out transactions shipped to a non-US country for this export. There might still be differences between files; some rows in the Shopify export don't have the ship to address as they're line items (we need to sort out a good way to filter those). Maybe the strategy before processing/data review: Filter the file for non-US Shipping locations. Before deleting those rows, copy the order name or ID. Store those IDs in another sheet. Delete the non-US shipping rows. Use VLOOKUP or similar to find rows that match the stored IDs. Delete the rows matching the IDs. Happy to help with this as well!"

Loop discount is enabled, but they use AvaTax, and that's needed there. (Adjustments or switch to Shopify tax until Eng can account for the loop discount if it's disabled, although that's not a guarantee.) Time zone differences, which includes refunds. ————————————————————————————————————————- Notes from the call with Jackie, Kayley (Shopify/Ecomm team), Tasia (analyst/ecomm team, and Carina (Cult Gaia CS) -45 minutes. Jackie said she's probably OK with adjustments and they want the refund for the extra tax paid. She wants to know the amount for the past overpayments and needs to share this with her CFO. They're not going to switch from or go off of AvaTax, they just upgraded and signed another contract (from the sound of it.) They'll let their CFO know. They use AvaTax with other countries as well. Shopify apps: They use NetSuite, which goes from Shopify to NetSuite via Celigo. Loop should be the only other one. NetSuite/Celigo —> Shopify: They don't have a flow to edit orders from NetSuite to Shopify. If they need to edit something, usually a tax-only refund (for taxable —> nontaxable changes in NJ since AvaTax is getting this wrong right now) and there are examples below.

The CSV that you shared is close to what we'll need, and I wanted to outline something I noticed about the sales data within the file and share a couple of questions I have. While reviewing the file, we noticed that about 136 transactions (rows within the file) lack details on the amount. I've attached an XLSX version of the file you shared that is filtered to those rows. Here are a couple of screenshots showing some of these transactions (rows): Questions: 1) Should the transactions (rows) without amounts be treated as $0? 2) If the answer to #1 is ""no,"" could you please share an updated file with the amounts associated with these transactions so we can import the data?

2836791595,98186,8885154863,message,2025-04-30T18:25:57Z,ryan@zamp.com,"Hi Mike & Eric, Chris is currently out of the office, so I'm stepping in to assist. Do you happen to log your requests to our /calculations endpoint, or associate them with the transactions on your side? If so, do you have a .txt export by chance? It would be great to see the request bodies on calculations and compare to the transaction data. For an explanation on timezone handling, here are a few key highlights: We ingest transactions and save them via UTC. So for example, if you pass to us a transaction  that you've localized the 'transactionDate' for as '2025-04-01T06:00:00.000Z', we will treat that as 6:00am UTC, which is technically 2025-03-31 as a reported transaction date. We now allow viewing transactions by a specific timezone in our Transactions interface when logged into Zamp, so you could view it in PST if you chose to. We file and localize transactions based on the state's timezone . When it comes down to states that span multiple timezones, we get even more specific and go by the timezone of the state's capitol . Timezones and compliance (in any industry) are always a bit of a monster, but we try to simplify it by always suggesting giving us the transactions in UTC, and offsetting to whatever standard you follow. For example, perhaps you treat all transactions (regardless of where they occur) as a realized sale based on PST. Hope this all makes some sense, timezones can be tricky!"

The transaction date they send to us and the transaction date we use for filing. Since the client is using our API, should we see variations due to time zones? We need the transaction data they are using to create the report, to find the cause of the difference, as Chris asked."

We can relieve some of this confusion if we could see the transaction date for tax purposes on the export file from your website. I would also appreciate a more technical explanation of why and when these two dates don't always coincide, and if there is anything we can do on our end to help reduce this dependency. ~Eric Atchison Lead Software Design Basics Etc Corp (714) 697-6573"
2836791595,98186,8862650713,note,2025-04-25T01:43:39Z,chris@zamp.com,"@nick @ryan @lucas - when you have some time, could any of you help look into this? The issue: The customer was expecting to see a tax payment of $40,575 for the remaining tax due for the Q1 2025 CA period (after January and February prepayments). The report they shared above (starting with 'RPT_Mike...') shows 40,720.24. They're based in CA, so it's unlikely that the cause is a time zone difference, but it could be (if they run their report in UTC vs. Zamp filing in PST, or some other edge-case difference). This is also an API customer, so we'd expect what they collect to match Zamp's calculations. So, this is a bit different from a Zamp vs Shopify reconciliation. For Zamp API customers, we set transactionRecalculate to true by default when creating transactions in Zamp; we always file based on taxDue not taxCollected (which is the opposite of what we do for Shopify/other non-API integrations.) What I've found so far: We see very little under-collection in the CA report ($0.22): https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/state-reports/CA/2025-Q1 These are all of the Q1 2025 CA transactions, $133k: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/transactions?date=2025-01-01~2025-03-31&shipToState=CA We see $42,455.63 for March 2025: https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas/transactions?date=2025-03-01%7E2025-03-31&shipToState=CA This is still higher than the initial estimate. Looking at all their transactions for Q1 2025 in CA, I don't see any transactions that likely caused this difference overall (in Q1 or March 2025) because they were primarily created or updated within the same period. Query: https://zamp.metabaseapp.com/question/6436-transaction-export-by-a-state-list-with-reportedon-and-zampcreated?company=clv2utyjn037p145m09arkdas&start=2025-01-01&end=2025-03-31 This export is attached. I don't see any concerns or significant variation between taxDue and taxCollected when exporting the variance review query here ; an export is attached. We may look at March 2025 for CA on its own, but I don't see causes for concern here. Overall, my theory is that there is a difference in reporting between their system and Zamp but I can't quite prove it yet."

On the Zamp side, we aren't seeing an indication of under-collection in sales tax, so the difference is likely related to the date and time values used for the transactions, or something else entirely. That said, we want to help sort this out and ensure we're all on the same page moving forward. When you have a moment, could you share the records or an export of the transaction data used to build the XLSX tax jurisdiction report you shared? This way, we can compare directly and confirm the causes based on expected behavior. We can also share an export of the data within Zamp if it would be helpful; our goal here is to sort out the differences in a way that saves you all time."

Yes—Zamp has access to the Shopify and Amazon sales data, which is automatically imported. We're waiting for the sales data in NetSuite for the month; typically, this is wholesale data. Typically, we'll need the data by the 5th of each month, but since this is not a quarterly month and Zamp doesn't have any filings for Cellap this month, we can be flexible here.

We looked into this further and found that the refund (#GILS1477) from the Gils Arena store was imported into Zamp; I've attached an export from Zamp showing this. This export can also be requested by logging into your Zamp portal and navigating to the Transactions page here with state and date range filters. Here's how to request an export: Just so you know, this screenshot was taken within a test account, and you will see something different within your Zamp account. Here's what I see within the Underdog Sports Holdings Zamp account: Here's what is happening with this refund: Within Zamp, a refund Transaction is not accounted for within the tax-due estimate if it will cause a local Jurisdiction to become negative (e.g., '-3.91' in this transaction's situation). The above means that this refund transaction (#GILS1477) caused the local jurisdiction of HAMPTON CITY to be negative, as there were $0 in sales to that jurisdiction. Most states do not allow sales tax returns to be filed with negative amounts. Please note that the Virginia Department of Taxation can issue a refund or credit. Their PDF documentation outlines how to submit such a request . Next steps: Do we have your approval to proceed with your sales tax filings for the January 2025 filing period this month? If Zamp is to file for Underdog Sports Holdings this month, we must hear back about this approval by Friday (2/14/25)."

I tried to do as much research on it as I could. The customer says that a refund is missing from their VA filing, but the refund does appear in our system and the report is zeroed out for associated jurisdiction. My guess is that they might be expecting the total $3.14 due in VA to be offset by refund #GILS1477 (-$3.91). The sales posted to VA this month are in other counties than where the refund is posted. I remember hearing that refunds are magic mathed to zero out, but I'm not familiar enough with how our system handles them.

Two other orders posted to this period were in FAIRFAX COUNTY & FAUQUIER COUNTY Original order Does not appear in the Jan 2025 period I think it's #GILS1477 that was reported with the Dec 2024 return Tranx list for Dec 2024 & Jan 2025 https://admin.zamp.com/companies/clz38bhkz012tkqe6ykleqfv5/transactions?from=2024-12-01&to=2025-01-31&shipToState=VA"

We then imported the data manually via CSV after requesting an export from QBO using this Zamp Sales Tax custom Report. Zamp's tax-due estimate amounts for Texas, Illinois, Alabama, and Indiana are now in line with your expectations. The differences here appear to be related to state-specific sales tax rounding, time zone differences between how Zamp files returns and QBO reports tax amounts, and state-specific timely filing discounts (which are included in most of our estimates.) Illinois's estimate is not $5,875.00. Texas' estimate is now $10,345.16. Alabama's estimate is not precisely $2,156.42. Please let us know if you have any questions. We'll need to get these filings started today to have them filed by or before the state's various sales tax filing and payment due dates."

They essentially use cash accounting, partly because sometimes payments fail for subscriptions in Stripe, and their CS team has a process to retry, reach out, etc, eventually it becomes 'uncollectible.' After explaining the human error when investigating the CSV/Zamp Stripe integration differences, River noted a large gross sales/revenue difference but a minimal tax difference. Due to the above, he was comfortable proceeding with the Stripe integration. The understanding here is that the voided or uncollectible transactions will eventually even out across multiple filing periods. We should expect about 3750+ transactions from Stripe altogether.

Google Sheet Gross without tax: $472,358.76 I think the subtotal in Stripe doesn't include the discount, which was $30,650.00. Before the discount this was $503,008.76 when using the Stripe subtotal. Stripe (Zamp) Gross with tax: $500,281.17 Google Sheet Gross with tax: $515,437.20 Stripe (Zamp) total tax: $42,044.87 Google Sheet total tax: $43,195.79 Note: The transactions that failed to import have totals of: Total $4,408.38 Tax: $362.38 This likely affects the difference. Voided transactions: Total: -$31,921.83 Total w/o tax: -$29,396.00 Tax: -$2,525.83 Snoozing this until the call with River to discuss the above."

Would you have time next week to discuss the differences, the logic of our Stripe integration, and the path forward? We can use this link to schedule a call: https://calendly.com/chris-zamp/30min . We found that the original total difference was incorrect due to a slight human/formula error. Additionally, I've confirmed that our Stripe integration is currently designed to import all invoices from Stripe regardless of the payment status; this aligns with Zamp's design to follow accrual-based accounting practices (instead of cash-based.) Our integration has logic in place to handle voided transactions and uncollectible transactions. We also do not import draft invoices."

2832855797,96811,8658504258,note,2025-02-21T01:31:50Z,chris@zamp.com,The relevant Stripe code is here: For invoices: https://github.com/zamptax/zamp/blob/main/domains/integration/src/stripe/invoices.ts Transform handling void and uncollectible invoice statuses: https://github.com/zamptax/zamp/blob/main/domains/integration/src/stripe/transform.ts Need to follow up with River and setup a call
2832855797,96811,8657618137,note,2025-02-20T20:29:56Z,nkondak@zamp.com,"So after looking into this: I believe the issue in difference is from using the auto sum function on excel and using different methods to find a subtotal and then total, it is giving different results. The results below are from using the total column sum by clicking on the header. Google sheet total (515,437.20) - Zamp total (515,272.81) = 164.39 (This is not accounting for discount in subtotal) Google Sheet tax   (43,195.79)    - Zamp tax.   (43,171.05) = 24.74 ( Zamp tax is different now since we are not using the stripe intergration now) In regards to the different amount of transactions with the automation, Zamp is importing 502 additional transactions. Most of them are a transaction and then supplemental voided transactions. There are 59 unaccounted-for transactions that I suspect are listed as a "" Failed or Not-paid"" status . River was filtering those out before posting them to the Google Sheet. I feel a call with the customer is needed to further understand any other filtering done and to see if they can set up their Stripe integration to Accrual instead of Cash based. CC @chris"

We have requested that these transactions be removed, and our engineering team will take care of them. We'll follow up immediately as soon as we hear that this has been completed. Because of how our Shopify integration is designed, there's a slight chance these transactions could be re-imported if they are changed in the future. That said, we are working towards solutions to prevent this in the future. Due to the above, we will also review the Final Switchback LLC Zamp account to ensure the test transactions are not present before the WA Q1 2025 filing is processed in April 2025.
