**Actors Involved:** 
The main actors in this conversation are Matt from Affordable Screen Company (previously referred to as Chris) and the Zamp team, specifically Chris from Zamp.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Matt from Affordable Screen Company is seeking assistance in calculating and collecting sales tax for orders shipped to different states with varying tax rates. He needs to charge sales tax for customers outside of Texas using QuickBooks Online and is looking for a solution to automate this process.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The company will charge a fixed 8.25% rate for Texas locations.

- The Zamp team will work on improving the integration with QuickBooks Online to support sales tax calculation.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Chris from Zamp has offered to share more details about how Affordable Screen Company can configure their accounting system for sales tax collection, including using a third-party API like Zamp's.
- The company will explore integrating a sales tax API (e.g., Zamp's) into their accounting system for real-time sales tax calculation.
- The Zamp team is currently going through Intuit's approval process for the QuickBooks Online integration.
- The expected timeline for completion is late June or early July.

**Current Status:** 
The company has been informed about its approach to sales tax collection and is awaiting further guidance on how to configure their accounting system. Additionally, the QuickBooks Online integration with Zamp is in review phase, awaiting Intuit's approval. Once approved, it will be ready for use by clients like Matt's company."

**Actors Involved:** 
The conversation involves two main actors, Hanna from The Wayo and Chris from Zamp.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**

- Chris created a note to remind himself to complete the refund transaction (CS-2156) and attached a transaction to Hanna's email on July 30, indicating that he had completed the refund.
- Chris updated the refund transaction using Zamp's tax calculation to recalculate the estimate tax related to the original transaction.

**Current Status:** 
The issue has been partially resolved with an update to the refund transaction. However, a discrepancy remains, and further investigation is needed to fully resolve the issue. The refund transaction has been completed, and Hanna should receive confirmation of the updated amount."

follow David tax calculation refund order tax close","**Unified Summary**

**Actors Involved:** 
The conversation involves David Krutky (customer) and Chris (Zamp representative), with occasional mentions of Becky (Tax Research Team member).

**Main Issue or Request:**
David is seeking assistance with importing historical BigCommerce data into XSTANCE, enabling Zamp's transaction sync feature, and discussing nexus analysis and tax settings for his BigCommerce store. He also needs help resolving issues related to tax exempt transactions, economic nexus thresholds, Amazon sales data, and time zone adjustments for sales tax filing purposes.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The conversation will continue the next day (August 1st).
- David will share a link to a calculation tab related to UK company sales.
- The customer needs to add a shipping origin setting in the BigCommerce store to enable Zamp to calculate taxes correctly.
- The customer should review their BigCommerce store's tax settings page to ensure it is correctly set up for nexus calculation.
- The customer has decided to exclude refund transactions from the threshold.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Chris will enable transaction sync and nexus analysis for David's store.
- Chris will review Becky's economic nexus analysis with David.
- Chris will help David adjust his tax settings based on the nexus analysis.
- Chris has shared concerns about internal record and nexus page data being different, which may affect tax calculations.
- He suggested disabling BigCommerce's fallback tax calculation (10% rate) as a potential solution.
- The Tax Research Team is investigating possible changes to exclude transactions based on the economic nexus threshold.
- David will provide more information for further investigation by the Tax Research Team.
- Chris is gathering research and planning to discuss the issue with David mid-week.
- Chris updates David on the progress of reviewing Amazon transactions and risk analysis.

**Current Status:**
The conversation is ongoing, with a plan to continue discussing nexus analysis and tax settings the next day. The customer is still experiencing issues with transaction data and nexus state tax calculations in the Zamp system, specifically with Amazon Marketplace transactions. Chris and David are actively working to resolve these problems, including addressing separate issues of calculating tax at the order level for partial refunds and determining if the threshold for registering with the state has been met."

**Actors Involved:** 
The main actors in this customer support conversation are Hanna from The Wayo, the customer requesting assistance with sale tax discrepancies and refunds, and Chris, the customer support representative working to resolve the issue.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Hanna from The Wayo is experiencing issues with sale tax discrepancies and refunds for transactions processed through Zamp's API. Specifically, she has noticed discrepancies in transaction ID visibility, calculation logic, and shipping timeline and tax refund. She initially received an estimate of $396.72 but noticed a discrepancy when recalculating the sale tax period using Zamp's API.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Chris will investigate and backdate fix the issue with California transactions.
- The team will release an improvement to ship taxability, specifically for the date range 1/1/2025 - 6/5/2025.
- Chris suggests generating a refund for the entire transaction due to the oversight.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Chris has provided detailed explanations of the calculation process and attached an Excel file to help Hanna review and identify the reason for the discrepancy.
- The team will recalculate the sale tax period using Zamp's API, focusing on the date range January 1, 2025 - June 5, 2025.
- Chris will analyze the export data and compare it with historical calculations on July 31, 2025.
- Chris plans to modify the SQL result export to include additional details about shipping handling and tax rates.
- Hanna has already refunded the correct sale tax amount of $396.95 for the order on June 5, 2025.
- Chris will import the corrected transaction into TheWayo's Zamp account.
- He will attach a file with an update on the dollar amount, shipping tax, and refund association.

**Current Status:** 
Chris is working to resolve the issue by analyzing the export data and comparing it with historical calculations. Hanna has already refunded the correct sale tax amount for one order, but she continues to investigate the cause of the initial discrepancy for future improvements. Chris aims to provide an update to Hanna on Thursday, July 31, 2025, and will adjust the transaction accordingly. He also plans to apply the corrected transaction according to the California Q3 2025 filing schedule process in October 2025."

Hi Sandy great meeting team moment ago previously discuss want include partner work canadian support Zamp work launch support SimplyVAT able assist interim well Ashley","**Unified Summary**

**Actors Involved:** 
The main actors in this customer support conversation are Sandy Jones from Iron Clad Consulting (previously referred to as Go-Ironclad and adewberry@zamp.com), Chris from Zamp, Ashley from Zamp, and David Protein.

**Main Issue or Request:**
Sandy is seeking assistance with discrepancies related to tax collection in Georgia. The main issues include:

1. Reconciliation of previous filing periods
2. Discrepancies in tax transactions, particularly related to Amazon transactions
3. Differences in filing for April 2025
4. Clarification on how SimplyVAT handles taxability for a specific product (David Protein) in Georgia

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The Zamp team analyzed the data to compare the Zamp Shopify report with other reports (RevRec) to identify discrepancies.
- A key finding was a significant difference in tax transactions, particularly related to Amazon transactions.
- The customer's account was investigated, and a line item file showing sales tax sums was provided.
- The team identified the source of the discrepancy as regular transactions with Amazon.
- Chris from Zamp explained that the issue might be due to a timezone difference between New York (David Protein's base) and Georgia (Zamp's location).
- A meeting has been scheduled for August 26th at 11:30 AM EST to discuss the Shopify order process.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
1. The Zamp team analyzed the data and identified the issue.
2. Chris from Zamp provided a detailed explanation of the discrepancy, attributing it to a timezone difference between New York (David Protein's base) and Georgia (Zamp's location).
3. A line item file showing sales tax sums was provided for the customer's account.
4. The team asked the customer to add a column to their export file to identify the source of each transaction.
5. Chris offered to discuss potential causes for the difference further with Sandy.
6. A meeting has been scheduled for August 26th at 11:30 AM EST to discuss the Shopify order process.

**Current Status:**
The issue remains unresolved, but progress has been made in identifying the cause of the discrepancy related to Amazon transactions and scheduling a meeting to discuss the Shopify order process. Chris from Zamp is providing detailed explanations to address Sandy's concerns, and Ashley will likely be involved in addressing Sandy's questions. The conversation is ongoing, with further investigation needed to resolve the issue."

**Actors Involved:** 
The main actors involved in this customer support conversation are Josh Reynolds from Paragon Print Systems and Chris from Zamp, along with the engineering tax research team at the company.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Both customers reported issues related to incorrect sales tax rates for specific addresses in Shreveport, LA. The Sales Tax Rate Lookup tool initially showed a 9.25% rate for Bossier Parish instead of the correct 8.35% rate for Caddo Parish. Chris from Zamp also experienced issues with the coordinate address provider in their system, specifically having trouble indicating the correct parish and county when searching for addresses.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The issue was escalated to the engineering tax research team for further investigation.
- It was determined that the discrepancy may be related to geography and tax datum boundaries.
- Kyle has been assigned to fix the issue with the address pin being incorrect and causing jurisdiction problems.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- The Tax Research Team is working on the issue, with a plan to share detailed information soon.
- The customer has been asked to continue being patient while the team investigates the situation.
- The company plans to follow up on the release once it is fixed.
- The customer from Zamp will prioritize this task and provide a fix as soon as possible.

**Current Status:** 
The Tax Research Team is still investigating the issue, which they find ""tricky"" due to tax geography datum and address coordinate complexities. They are working on confirming the correct rate for the Shreveport, LA address using the Louisiana Rate Lookup Tool. The issue with Chris from Zamp's system is also ongoing but work is underway to resolve it, albeit at a slow turnaround due to a backlog."

Mike check provide datum need transaction thank John","**Unified Summary**

**Actors Involved:** 
The conversation involves two main actors: Mike (mkupka@basicsetc.com) and John from Zamp. The Technical Success Team is also mentioned as a supporting entity that assists in resolving the issues.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Mike, the customer, has multiple requests:
1. He needs assistance with API integration for filing a delinquent return for April 2024 in Nevada.
2. He requires help generating a sales tax report for the state of Texas, specifically for the period from June 1st to June 12th, 2024 (although there is confusion about the correct time frame).
3. John from Zamp has separate requests:
   - Assistance with importing Texas sales tax reports using the AP push API.
   - Help generating a report for the state of Texas.

**Key Decisions Made:** 
- The Technical Success Team will review the difference in reporting between Zamp datum and Texas June 2024 filing period.
- Although not explicitly stated, it appears that the customer and support team are working together to identify the correct time period for the reports.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
1. Mike was asked to send a CSV file with sale tax return data in the correct format.
2. The Technical Success Team will look into the API integration and push datum for Nevada.
3. John from Zamp has sent multiple messages with different date ranges, which may indicate confusion about the correct time frame.
4. John provided information on the transaction data and suggested that the issue might be related to missing or incorrect data in the API.
5. The customer has asked for help generating a report for the state of Texas.

**Current Status:** 
The conversation is ongoing with multiple issues being addressed simultaneously:
1. Mike's request for assistance with API integration for Nevada is still pending, but he has confirmed seeing the state portal period reference show unpaid.
2. John from Zamp continues to request updates and assistance with importing the Texas sales tax reports using the AP push API.
3. The Technical Success Team is reviewing the difference in reporting between Zamp datum and Texas June 2024 filing period.

The conversation requires further resolution on multiple fronts, including identifying the correct time frame for the reports, resolving issues related to missing or incorrect data in the API, and completing the API integration for Nevada."

**Actors Involved:** 
The customer support conversation involves Sean Brown from Whale Enterprises and the Zamp customer support team, specifically Carie and Chris.

**Main Issue or Request:**
Sean Brown is seeking assistance with handling sale tax for Zamp's road map cover type event solution. He also requests an update on the discussion regarding Memorabilia vs Clothing and the sale tax holiday in Ohio. Additionally, he wants to create a draft page and provide an update on the Ohio Expanded Sales Tax Holiday support for Zamp.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The customer support team acknowledges the issue and plans to discuss it further.
- Carie assigns the case as ""lose"" due to the urgency of the situation.
- Chris agrees that Carie's draft looks good.
- The team decides to wait before sharing a file related to refund handling until they are sure about how to handle it correctly.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- A meeting is scheduled between Sean Brown and a Zamp representative (Carie) to discuss the sale tax handling for the road map cover type event solution.
- Carie sent an invitation to Sean Brown, but no specific time has been confirmed yet.
- The team plans to explore alternative ways to handle sale tax during the interim period, as the current support for sale tax holiday is not available.
- Carie will create a file with an update on the Ohio Expanded Sales Tax Holiday support for Zamp.
- Chris and Carie will discuss and coordinate the integration design to ensure that there is no double counting of refunds.
- The team will prioritize standardizing time zones in work products.

**Current Status:**

**Actors Involved:** 
The customer, Simon Kimani and later Betty Chebet from Chebet Dynamics 365, interacted with the Zamp support team consisting of Kyle, Christine, Matt, Chris from Zamp Technical Success.

No specific decisions were made during these conversations, as they focused on understanding the customer's issues and requirements.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**

1. The Zamp support team acknowledged the issue and is working to resolve it.

**Actors Involved:** 
The customer, Jim Miller from AsteroGroup.com, and the Zamp Team.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Jim Miller requested to calculate a $11k number for July close and collect sale tax. He also intended to receive an email with confidential information but made a mistake in the recipient's email address.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The Zamp Team will provide an estimate of sale tax for Pausmith Group Inc.
- Jim decided to proceed with the delayed filing, which was necessary due to the complexity of the issue and potential penalty associated with late filing.
- The customer will review and approve the filing notice by August 19th.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- The Zamp Team provided a direct transaction number (QuickBooks Online 1264) and transaction amount ($1082,1286).
- The team is renaming the connection to help with file sharing and filtering.
- A state table will be provided to estimate tax for Pausmith Group Inc.
- Payment was held until August 19th by the support team to prevent a late filing penalty.

**Current Status:** 
The Zamp Team has acknowledged Jim's request, is working on providing an estimate of sale tax for July close (including a prepayment of $11,609.00), and preparing a filing notice that needs to be reviewed and approved by August 19th. The customer's tax transaction has been delayed, but payment will be made on August 19th to avoid an additional penalty."

Additionally, Marjorie is concerned about a $20,876.54 sales tax estimate for the month and wants to know if it's normal.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Chris from Zamp Team will investigate the minor percentage difference in the sales tax estimate.
- The team needs to investigate further into the discrepancy between Shopify report and Vetchy LLC filing notice.
- A response from Marjorie is required for progress on resolving the issue.
- The team will discuss potential causes with Ashley and come up with an action plan.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Chris has started investigating the issue and will follow up soon with a possible step for resolution.
- Marjorie will be scheduled to discuss the potential cause of the variance with Ashley.
- The Zamp Team will work on making adjustments to ensure timely filing, starting from September 2025.
- Chris provided instructions on how to regain access by sharing a Shopify Collaborator Access Code and setting up separate integration sync with Vetchy store.

**Current Status:**
The issue remains unresolved, awaiting further investigation and potential adjustments. The Zamp Team is working on resolving the discrepancy between the Shopify report and Vetchy LLC filing notice, as well as addressing Marjorie's concerns about the sales tax estimate. Once Chris receives a response from Marjorie, the team can proceed with further investigation and potential adjustments to resolve the matter efficiently."

**Actors Involved:** 
- Akiko (customer support representative)
- Chris from Zamp (customer)
- Engineering team
- Technical Success team
- Amelia (mentioned as someone Chris will coordinate with for timely tax filing)

**Main Issue or Request:**
The main issues or requests revolve around two primary concerns:
1.  Akiko is unable to pull a report for the 2024 calendar year due to an application error and client exception.
2. Chris from Zamp seeks assistance in understanding and comparing Shopify's United States Sales Tax report with their own transactions data.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The engineering team was escalated to resolve the issue related to pulling the 2024 tax report.
- Although not explicitly stated, it seems that Chris has decided to use Shopify's Taxes Report instead of the Shopify Tax Datum for accurate tax calculations.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
1.  The engineering team successfully pulled the 2024 tax report but found discrepancies in the sales data between Zamp and Shopify.
2.  The Technical Success team will review the taxes collect portion of the report.
3.  Chris needs to investigate the gross sale difference between QuickBooks Online (QBO) and Shopify transactions.
4.  Akiko is working with Chris to compare Zamp's transactions with Shopify's United States Sales Tax report.
5.  Chris suggested using Shopify's Taxes Report directly for accurate tax calculations.

**Current Status:**
The issue has been escalated to the engineering and Technical Success teams, but there are still discrepancies in the sales data that need to be investigated. The conversation is ongoing, with Akiko working closely with Chris to resolve both issues related to pulling the 2024 report and comparing Shopify's United States Sales Tax report with Zamp's transactions data."

**Actors Involved:** 
The conversation involves Chris from Koio Collective Inc. (previously referred to as Koio Co.) and the Zamp Team, specifically Ashley.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Chris is seeking assistance with finalizing their tax jurisdiction, ensuring timely payment for August 2025, and closing their account due to state-specific requirements. The main issues include:

1. Final sale tax filing and prepayment
2. Handling of duplicate tax adjustments
3. Ensuring adequate funds are available for remittance by August 15th
4. Closing the account in multiple states

**Key Decisions Made:**

1. A tax estimate will be included in the transaction for July 2025.
2. The state remainder cannot be adjusted, which may cause a negative refund amount due to local jurisdiction rules.
3. The Zamp Team confirmed they will execute the final filing for the jurisdiction.
4. A remittance amount of $173.97 needs to be adjusted due to an exception in New Jersey and Pennsylvania states.
5. Chris will handle the final filing process, with Zamp assisting and providing guidance on state-specific requirements.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**

1. The customer is advised to ensure timely filing by August 15th for the month of July 2025.
2. A Zamp Filing Notice will be sent with additional information on how to file and review the tax estimate.
3. The team will provide a detailed breakdown of estimated sales taxes for each state.
4. Chris needs to start the de-registration process for multiple states, as guided by Zamp.
5. Ashley helped the customer understand how to fill out forms for Arizona, Colorado, and other states.
6. A POA (Power of Attorney) file process with an electronic signature is necessary for closing the account in North Carolina, Illinois, and Massachusetts.

**Current Status:**
The conversation is ongoing as Chris continues to seek assistance with navigating state online portals and closing their account in multiple states. The next steps include:

1. Submitting a letter from his company on letterhead with an effective date and signature for the POA file process.
2. Confirming the closure of accounts in Illinois, Massachusetts, and Texas.
3. Starting the de-registration process for listed states.

The customer has been informed about the necessary steps to close their account in Georgia and other states, but it seems that Maryland accounts can remain open."

**Actors Involved:** 
The customer, Jacob Gorny from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and Chris from Zamp's Technical Success team.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Jacob is experiencing issues with tax collection on orders shipped to Texas in his BigCommerce store. He wants to configure Avalara for special tax handling but is having trouble getting it set up correctly. The main issue also involves improving the integration experience between Zamp and BigCommerce, specifically in terms of tax configuration and service description space.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Chris from Zamp decided to assist Jacob in resolving the issue.
- The Technical Success team suggested referring to an immediate support article that specifies how to turn on state sales tax collection in BigCommerce.
- It was determined that BigCommerce provides dev control for service description space, and a message alert will be provided in the future to prevent similar situations.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Chris shared detailed instructions on how to enable Texas as a taxable state in BigCommerce, including navigating the admin panel and adding the state to the tax settings.
- The Technical Success team offered to continue improving the integration process based on Jacob's feedback.
- Chris is conducting research with Blayzer Indisea to base preliminary research on Zamp app display settings and their potential impact on BigCommerce areas.

**Current Status:** 
The issue has been partially resolved, as Jacob is now able to configure his BigCommerce store with Texas as a taxable state. However, the customer is still experiencing issues with tax collection on orders shipped to Texas, which requires further assistance from the support team or his tech team to resolve completely. The Technical Success team and Chris are continuing to research and address the issue to improve the integration experience between Zamp and BigCommerce."

**Actors Involved:** 
The conversation involves two main actors: Louis, the customer with a Shopify store experiencing issues with setting up sales tax collection for his stock sale from August to October, and Ashley at Zamp, who is assisting Louis in resolving the issue.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Louis has a Shopify store and needs help with adding extra states and checking the setup for sales tax collection. He requires assistance in correctly setting up sales tax collection for his stock sale from August to October.

**Key Decisions Made:**
Although no key decisions are explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that Louis provided Ashley at Zamp with a collaborator access code (9954) to review the Shopify store settings and explore possible solutions. However, more complex discussions or explorations of options might be required to find a suitable solution for Louis's needs.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
Ashley reviewed the Shopify store settings and provided guidance on setting up sales tax collection. A note from Chris at Zamp suggested exploring an alternative approach using a Google Drive folder with a different script to handle the sales tax collection. However, it seems that no concrete actions have been taken yet.

**Current Status:** 
The issue is still being addressed, and Ashley is working with Louis to set up sales tax collection correctly. A more complex solution might be needed, requiring further discussion or exploration of options to find a suitable solution for the customer's needs."

**Actors Involved:** 
The conversation involves multiple customers, including Bryan Hohlfelder from Save-Ty.com and Chris from Zamp. Technical Success and the support team are also involved in resolving issues related to tax filing for various states.

**Main Issue or Request:**
The main issue or request revolves around resolving tax filing issues for different states, specifically:

1.  Bryan Hohlfelder's issue with a zero value in the sale section of their Colorado tax filing.
2.  A customer experiencing an import file fix issue related to the CSV import process for filing sales tax returns.
3.  Chris from Zamp requesting clarification and confirmation on tax collection requirements for various states (IL, MN, PA, KY, WA, MO, WI, OH) and the filing frequency for their state taxes.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- The root cause of the issue was identified as a problem with carrying transactions forward.
- A solution was implemented to resolve the situation and prevent similar scenarios in the future.
- Engineering team involvement was necessary to address the issue.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Technical Success was notified to help resolve the issue related to Bryan Hohlfelder's Colorado tax filing.
- A note from NKondak suggests that the issue might be related to an admin account transaction import, which will be investigated further.

The conversation has been concluded, with the customer confirming their understanding of the tax collection requirements and filing frequencies. An amendment request is being processed by compliance."

**Actors Involved:** 
The main actors in this customer support conversation are Zoya Mirza (CPA and Fractional Head of Finance for Science On Call) and the team at Zamp, including Chris, Amelia, and Taryn from Tech Success.

**Main Issue or Request:**
Science On Call is experiencing issues with collecting sales tax through Stripe, specifically in Texas and Nebraska. The main issue revolves around a discrepancy between the actual sales tax collected ($8k) and the $0 return on file. Additionally, Zoya needs assistance understanding the tax collection process and setting up her account correctly.

- Schedule a meeting between Taryn (Tech Success) and Zoya to discuss the issue.
- The customer will investigate the reason for nearly $8,000 not being collected.

- Amelia from Zamp set up a schedule in Stripe to collect sales tax on Monday.
- The Engineering Team is reviewing the issue to provide a solution.

Chris has started reviewing the Stripe account data to understand the cause of the discrepancy in sales tax collection. The customer's sales tax collection issue is being investigated, but there may be a delay in following up due to other priorities. Further assistance may be required to address the discrepancy in the Q2 2025 filing for Texas-based records."

**Actors Involved:** 
- PoM (Pronto Marketing)
- Zamp team
- Keylight team
- Chris from Zamp

**Main Issue or Request:**
The main issue or request is to set up a sales tax reporting system for transactions on the Zamp platform, excluding commission expenses and bad debts. The customer also needs assistance with API integration between Keylight and Zamp to configure commission orders and bad debt orders while preventing related transactions from syncing.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Commission expense and bad debt will be properly excluded from sales tax reporting.
- Specific types of transactions (commission expense and bad debt) will be excluded from syncing between the two systems.
- The R_SRV code for commission bad debt products was added, and bad debt orders are handled by stopping the product from being pushed through Zamp.
- Address validation failing when trying to save billing addresses was resolved by disabling the Hook Integration and updating configuration.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- API integration will be implemented to exclude specific tax codes and conditions for transaction syncing.
- The Keylight team will provide guidance on implementing the API integration and excluding commission expenses and bad debts from sales tax reporting.
- The customer's account will be updated to remove economic nexus analysis and prevent future transactions from being recreated.
- Additional configuration is required, including Address Validation and setting up an integration hook for SBX.
- The setup of the ZAMP integration needs to be completed, including verifying the Best Rangi configuration.
- Pom's team will update the transactions by end of week to resolve a decimal discrepancy.

**Current Status:**
The issue is currently being addressed by the Zamp and Keylight teams. A plan is in place to implement API integration and exclude specific types of transactions from syncing. The customer support conversation is ongoing, with updates provided on several occasions. The decimal discrepancy has been identified as potentially caused by rounding settings in a spreadsheet tool (Excel or Google Sheets), and assistance is being offered to resolve the issue soon."

**Unified Summary:**

**Actors Involved:**

- Nick from Zamp (Technical Success team member)

**Main Issue or Request:**

Note: Although the second partial summary mentioned that the issue had been resolved in the previous conversation, it seems there was confusion or miscommunication as the main issue or request in this conversation remains unresolved."

Stephen is experiencing issues with discrepancies in their Shopify sale tax report for the state of New York. The reported figure does not match the expected amount.

- Chris is preparing to share a screenshot and export a report for comparison to help clarify the issue with Tocco Leggero's tax estimate and prepayment.
- Chris will troubleshoot Shopify's expired login issue, provide separate integration for automatic sync of sale data, and assist in manually editing Shopify orders if necessary using the party app.

**Current Status:**

Chris from Zamp's Technical Success team is actively working on resolving the matter, with a goal of providing an update or solution by the end of day Wednesday (September 3).

hi Chris want update email thank Sandy Jones Iron Clad Consulting Controller","**Unified Summary**

**Actors Involved:** 
The customer, Sandy Jones from Iron Clad Consulting, and the support team members Ashley and Chris Ralph (though only Ashley is mentioned in most of the conversation).

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Sandy Jones from Iron Clad Consulting has multiple requests for assistance with their EIN account on Zamp. The main issues include:
- Creating a snapshot of their new EIN account, including Sales Tax collection and filing information for August.
- Pulling the Sales Tax Liability report to determine if they are eligible for a discount.
- Understanding and calculating sales tax liabilities for a new entity in Washington.
- Resolving discrepancies between collected and remitted taxes in Colorado (though this is not explicitly mentioned as part of the main issue).
- Investigating missing deductions for Linus Technology Inc. and its subsidiary, MergerSub LLC, related to Alabama sales tax collection.

**Key Decisions Made:** 
- The customer needs assistance with pulling the tax liability amount from Zamp Filings.
- The customer requires help in determining if they can submit their gross filing for a possible discount.
- The team investigated the sale tax collection in Alabama and found that there was a liability of $1,700 which should be remitted early to take advantage of an early filing discount.

**Actions Taken or Planned:** 
- Ashley (support) has acknowledged the request and is working on it.
- A note was sent to NY, indicating that someone will assist with the New York filing.
- Ashley asked for assistance from the technical success team to help pull the tax liability amount from Zamp Filings.
- The customer was provided with a spreadsheet reflecting sale tax liability for Washington.
- A new entity's data was attached for review.
- The support team is working on finalizing the filing for the previous entity.
- Ashley offered to update the customer soon, but no specific timeline was mentioned.
- The team informed the customer about the findings and the need to remit the Alabama sales tax liability early.

**Current Status:** 
The issue remains unresolved due to an unexpected delay in providing a final answer regarding the state tax collection in Washington. The customer is still seeking clarification on how to determine sales tax liabilities in Washington, and they have asked Ashley to investigate further and provide an answer to their question regarding a discrepancy between collected and remitted taxes in Colorado."

**Actors Involved:** 
- Katelynn Schultz from Reese Henry Company (customer)
- Amelia from Zamp (support representative initially mentioned, but not directly involved in the conversation)
- Chris from Zamp's Technical Success team (support representative who interacted with the customer)

**Main Issue or Request:**
The customer, Katelynn Schultz, sought assistance with setting up the Zamp QuickBooks Online app to ensure timely filing of tax returns. Specifically, she wanted to capture historical data and set up a sync period that includes October 3, 2025.

**Key Decisions Made:**

- Later, she decided to target January 1, 2026, as the start date for the app.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**

**Customer Support Conversation**

**Manu:** Hi, I'm experiencing a delay in the checkout process. Every time I add or remove items from my cart, it's asking for tax calculations again. Can we get the tax amount directly based on zip code and state instead?

**Support Team (Zamp):** Sorry to hear that, Manu. We can't provide a list of tax rates by zip code and state due to our system limitations.

**Manu:** Okay, what's the alternative then?

**Support Team (Zamp):** You can use our /calculation API to get the tax rate sum for each item in your cart. This way, you'll only need to make one request instead of multiple requests for tax calculations.

**Manu:** That sounds like a good solution. How do I implement this?

**Support Team (Zamp):** We recommend implementing a debounce mechanism on your cart update to ensure API calls are made at least every 500 milliseconds. Additionally, we plan to batch cart changes and make a single API call to our /calculation endpoint.

**Manu:** That makes sense. When can I expect these changes to be implemented?

**Support Team (Zamp):** Our team is working on implementing these changes as soon as possible to minimize delays during the checkout process.

Now, let's create a comprehensive summary:

**Unified Summary**

- **Actors involved:** Manu (customer) and Zamp Support Team
- **Main issue or request:** Manu is experiencing delays in the checkout process due to frequent requests for tax calculations when adding or removing items from his cart. He wants to receive the tax amount directly based on zip code and state.

**Actors Involved:** 
The customer, Sandeep, is seeking assistance from the support team to resolve issues with transaction sync in WooCommerce.

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Sandeep is experiencing difficulties with transaction sync in WooCommerce, specifically with the ZampTax plugin and Stripe Gateway. The main issue has two parts: 

1.  Understanding how to correctly fetch historical transactions.
2.  Updating order status and handling random characters in WooCommerce order numbers to avoid duplicate transactions and ensure accurate historical syncing.

**Key Decisions Made:** 
Two key decisions have been made during the conversation:

1.  Recalculating parameters with `false` will be used to perform transaction sync.
2.  Tax collection (`taxcollecte`) should be set to `$0`.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
The following actions are planned or have been taken:

1.  The customer (Sandeep) provided detailed information about the transaction sync process, including the need to verify tax updates in WooCommerce.
2.  Sandeep was informed about the need to recalculate parameters and toggle a setting for customer choice to resolve the issue.

**Current Status:** 
The issue remains unresolved, but key decisions have been made. Further action is required from the customer (e.g., updating settings) before the issue can be fully resolved. Historical syncing is expected to occur normally after these changes are implemented."

hi Robert welcome great set","**Unified Customer Support Conversation Summary**

**Actors Involved:** 
- Robert (customer) from Bag Borrow Steal
- Chris Ralph (Technical Success at Zamp)
- The Zamp team

**Main Issue or Request:** 
Robert is experiencing issues with calculating and remitting Maryland state taxes on orders, specifically needing the system to accurately calculate discounts and apply them correctly.

**Actions Taken or Planned:**
- Chris provided an invoice number (8057642) related to the order in question.
- He explained that a custom integration example using the API is needed to calculate discounts correctly, specifically referencing the `lineitems.[x].discount` property.
- Chris attached an example JSON file for API integration and plans to send a current integration example via email to Robert.
- The customer's resale certificate will be processed to remove tax collection from the order.
- A refund for the order (transaction 8173260) will be created, and the customer's tax-exempt status will be noted.
